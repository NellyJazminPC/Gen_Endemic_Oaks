This study aims to evaluate the diversity and population structure of Persian oak in the western forests of Iran using morphological features. A total of 187 samples were collected from 15 locations in the Ilam province. Twenty phenotypic traits related to leaf, seed, and trunk characteristics were evaluated. Several multivariate statistical analyses were performed. The results revealed significant morphological diversity among the Persian oak ecotypes. Correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between leaf length attribute and distance from leaf base to maximum leaf width (0.55) and maximum width of the leaflet (0.64) traits. The leaf width at 50% attribute with the maximum width of the leaflet and distance from leaf base to maximum leaf width have a positive (0.8 and 0.51 respectively) and significant correlation (p≤0.05). According to principal component analysis, the components of leaf and seed traits have the most impact on morphological variance. Hierarchical cluster analysis divided the locations into two groups, with some oak locations distributed in two clusters, indicating higher diversity of this species in different locations.

They have been an important resource of timber, fuelwood and animal feed for humans, who actively promoted their presence in forests and other landscape types at least since the early historical times. Besides stands with intensive management, putatively relict populations of three native oak species can be found on unproductive sites with restricted accessibility. Here, we apply chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers in order to address the autochthony of relict and managed stands and compare the spatial distribution of genetic variation between them. Based on data from more than 150 populations, we demonstrate that oak autochthony was preserved throughout historical times which is likely the result of traditional silvicultural treatment. This is supported by the fact that the spatial pattern of chloroplast haplotype distribution still reflects the post-glacial recolonization in both relict and old managed stands. We observed significant admixture of haplotypes only in stands established after the Second World War, which is attributable to the transfer of reproductive material used for afforestation. In terms of nuclear genetic variation, we observed marked differences among species. Quercus pubescens exhibited a pronounced genetic structure. Genetic drift and limited gene flow among its small and isolated populations in our study area might have contributed to this pattern. Varying extent of genetic introgression with other sympatric oak species could offer an additional explanation. On the contrary, the gene pools of Q. petraea and Q. robur are highly homogenous, displaying only weak isolation-by-distance. We found no significant differences of genetic diversity and differentiation between relict and managed stands. This suggests that seed transfer mostly occurred within our study area, even in those stands established in post-war times, verifying previous findings which point out limited human interference. We recommend consideration of population genetic structure for gene conservation, with a finer resolution of gene conservation units needed for Q. pubescens due to its spatial genetic structure. Both relict and old managed stands, species-pure or mixed, are suitable for conservation, as they host autochthonous gene pools. Coppice-with-standard management could contribute to preservation of autochthony. In the face of climate change, it is also important to maintain the evolutionary potential of the stands, by facilitating generative reproduction and allowing for hybridization in mixed stands.",,,,,,,,,,,,01/01/24,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/3Q7X9WXL/S0378112723007880.html,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121554,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112723007880,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/NLG2Y7YA

Among other stressing factors, chronic herbivory endangers Quercus ilex, a tree playing a central role in Mediterranean forests. This work addressed the connections between the chemical defenses of Q. ilex leaves and their susceptibility to herbivory, quantitative traits whose relationships are modulated by environmental and genetic factors that could be useful as molecular markers for the selection of plants with improved fitness. A search for natural variants detected the polymorphism D165H in the effector domain of QiMYB-like-1, a TT2-like transcription factor whose family includes members that control the late steps of condensed tannins biosynthesis in different plant species. QiMYB-like-1 D165H polymorphism was screened by PCR-RFLP in trees from six national parks in Spain where Q. ilex has a relevant presence, revealing that, unlike most regions that match the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, homozygous plants are over-represented in “Monfragüe” and “Cabañeros”, among the best examples to represent the continental Mediterranean (cM) ecosystem. Accordingly, the averages of two stress-related quantitative traits measured in leaves, herbivory index and accumulation of condensed tannins, showed asymmetric distributions depending on the clustering of trees based on ecological and genetic factors. Thus, the impact of herbivory was greater in managed forests with a low density of trees from the cM region, among which QiMYB-like-1 D165 homozygotes stand out, whereas condensed tannins accumulation was higher in leaves of QiMYB-like-1 H165 homozygotes from low-density forests, mainly in the Pyrenean (Py) region. Besides, the correlation between the contents of condensed tannins and total tannins vanished after clustering by the same factors: the cM region singularity, forest tree density, and QiMYB-like-1 genotype, among which homozygous shared the lowest link. The biogeographical and genetic constraints that modulate the contribution of condensed tannins to chemical defenses also mediated their interactions with the herbivory index, which was found positively correlated with total phenolics or tannins, suggesting an induction signal by this biotic stress. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed with condensed tannins after tree clustering by genetics factors where associations between tannins were lost. Therefore, condensed tannins might protect Q. ilex from defoliation in parks belonging to the cM ecosystem and carrying genetic factor(s) linked to the QiMYB-like-1 D165H polymorphism.",,,,,,,,,,,,2023/1,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/UPZQQ92S/Gallardo et al. - 2023 - The D165H Polymorphism of QiMYB-like-1 Is Linked t.pdf,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24010151,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/1/151,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/ZHBQS588

First, we conducted a detailed survey of the populations in China. Second, we collated all the literature and information. Finally, genome-wide genetic variation was analyzed based on 65 individuals from 22 populations. We found that Q. gilva has suffered rapid population decline, and at present, most populations are very small.

Comparison was made with the previously obtained chloroplast DNA data. A low level of nuclear DNA introgression of Q. petraea in Q. robur was revealed. No significant influence of Q. petraea on the geographic structure of Q. robur diversity was found. High differentiation in nuclear markers between populations of Q. robur from different geographical regions and within the Caucasus was obtained. According to the results of the Bayesian clustering implemented with STRUCTURE program, the largest difference in Q. robur was observed between Caucasian populations and the populations of North Eastern Europe. This subdivision is quite consistent with the deep differences in chloroplast DNA between these regions, where no common or closely related chloroplast haplotypes have been found, and indicates an ancient age of the isolation of the Caucasus, estimated from microsatellite data using the ABC method as 3500 generations (~350 ka ago, Middle Pleistocene). In the north of Eastern Europe, according to STRUCTURE results, a weak trend from east to west was observed, in contrast to the chloroplast DNA data indicating a sharp difference between the populations of the east of the Russian Plain and Urals from the more western ones due to the absence of common haplotypes. The populations of the southeastern Balkans differed from the populations of North Eastern Europe, and the ABC estimate of divergence time (910 generations) significantly exceeded the age of the Last Glacial Maximum, which rejected the participation of southeastern region of the Balkans in the recolonization of Eastern Europe after the last glaciation. In the Caucasus, the structure of nuclear DNA generally corresponded to the phylogeography of chloroplast DNA and to the morphological data. Deep differentiation was found in nuclear DNA between western and eastern Caucasian populations, with an estimated age of divergence of 2100 generations. In the Crimea and the extreme Western Caucasus, STRUCTURE revealed a mixture of the Balkan and West Caucasian clusters, which, in combination with chloroplast DNA data, indicates their origin as a result of multiple migrations. This group of populations contains only West Caucasian and Crimean endemic chloroplast haplotypes, without the presence of Balkan haplotypes, which indicates the introgression of the genes of the Balkan cluster into the Crimean and West Caucasian populations through pollen flow, without seed transfer.

The difference between the western part of the peninsula and the eastern part is shown, which suggests a multiple origin of oak populations in the Crimea as a result of migrations from two sources, which could be facilitated by fluctuations in the Black Sea level and its desalination, which repeatedly occurred in the Pleistocene and Holocene. The predominance of two divergent haplotypes in the western part of the peninsula, similar to the haplotypes of Asia Minor, indicates the penetration of oak from this region and the presence of an isolated refugium in the mountainous forest regions of Crimea during the last glacial maximum. At the same time, haplotypes common with the Western Caucasus are spread in the east of the mountain-forest part of the Eastern Crimea.

Here, we explore how cork oaks achieved their modern ranges and how legacy effects might explain niche evolution in modern species of section Cerris and its sister section Ilex, the holly oaks.We inferred a dated phylogeny for cork and holly oaks using a reduced-representation next-generation sequencing method, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and used D-statistics to investigate gene flow hypotheses. We estimated divergence times using a fossilized birth–death model calibrated with 47 fossils. We used Köppen profiles, selected bioclimatic parameters and forest biomes occupied by modern species to infer ancestral climatic and biotic niches.East Asian and Western Eurasian cork oaks diverged initially in the Eocene. Subsequently, four Western Eurasian lineages (subsections) differentiated during the Oligocene and Miocene. Evolution of leaf size, form and texture was correlated, in part, with multiple transitions from ancestral humid temperate climates to mediterranean, arid and continental climates. Distantly related but ecologically similar species converged on similar leaf traits in the process.Originating in temperate (frost-free) biomes, Eocene to Oligocene ranges of the primarily deciduous cork oaks were restricted to higher latitudes (Siberia to north of Paratethys).

Quercus variabilis is a widely distributed tree species in the Republic of Korea. It is ecologically adapted to the local environment and is thus a useful resource for tree breeding in the Republic of Korea. Most populations are secondary forests resulting from ecological succession. In this study, we estimated the genetic diversity and structure of natural populations of Q. variabilis. We used 10 microsatellite markers to genetically analyze 691 samples from 20 populations. The mean observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were 0.673 and 0.691, respectively. The genetic diversity of Q. variabilis was moderate compared to other Quercus species. The mean pairwise FST value was 0.010 and the фST value was 0.013, based on AMOVA. The mean FST value was 0.022 from Wright’s F-statistics. The genetic differentiation was very low compared to other Quercus species. Additionally, we did not find any genetic clustering using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, principal coordinates analysis, or Bayesian cluster analysis. No correlation was detected between geographical and genetic distances (r = 0.005, P = 0.472). Therefore, the genetic diversity and structure of Q. variabilis may be affected by dynamic factors such as biological characteristics, evolutionary history, disturbance, and adaptation.

While large sets of SNPs have been developed for the species, there is a continued need for smaller sets of SNPs that are highly informative about the possible adaptation to this varied landscape. By using double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing data from our previous study, we mapped RAD-seq loci to the Quercus robur reference genome and identified a set of SNPs putatively related to drought stress-response. A total of 179 individuals from eighteen natural populations at sites covering heterogeneous climatic conditions in the southeastern natural distribution range of Q. petraea were genotyped.

Quercus magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa are two endemic oak species distributed across the Mexican highlands. These species diverged ecological and morphologically; however, no nuclear genetic differentiation is evident. In this study, we determined the mechanisms that shape patterns of genetic variation and establish the role of migration and hybridization in the evolutionary history of these two oak species. To do this, Bayesian approaches were used for inference on migration rates and directionality and timing of divergence between species using chloroplast microsatellites. We then integrated species distribution models to infer the geographic distribution of Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa during Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, and Mid-Holocene time frames. We failed in distinguishing a unique genetic composition for each species. Chloroplast differentiation was more congruent with geography than the taxonomic status of each species. Our study revealed that after the divergence (c. 10 Mya) of these two oak species, high rates of introgression took place at the end of the Pleistocene. Furthermore, past distribution models predicted that Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa have likely been in sympatry presumable since Last Glacial Maximum and Q. resinosa probably expanded geographically towards its current distribution around Mid-Holocene. This expansion was supported by testing migration models, suggesting recent establishment of Q. resinosa to the north of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. We hypothesized that after Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa diverged, colonization events followed by hybridization between oaks and long-distance seed dispersal occurred, explaining the present-day patterns of distribution of chloroplast diversity.

Nuclear and chloroplast DNA microsatellite markers were used to describe the genetic diversity and structure of 39 populations of Q. mexicana along its entire distribution area. We tested whether population expansion or contraction events influenced the genetic diversity and structure of the species.

Here, we present genomic evidence that parkland oak populations harbour considerable diversity and grew from local seed sources. We found some evidence for natural regeneration of offspring and for hybridization between pedunculate and sessile oak. We detected signatures of past gene flow between these two species and few regions of high differentiation within their genomes. Future expansion of this dataset may allow us to test for a genomic basis of acute oak decline, a syndrome of particular concern in parkland environments. Summary The two predominant oak species in Europe, Quercus robur (English or pedunculate oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak), have a long history of human intervention. In Britain, a common management regime is parklands, often surrounding country houses. Little is known about how seeds were sourced for parkland oak populations nor the genetic diversity that they contain. We sequenced the whole genomes of 386 trees from four British parkland sites to characterize the nuclear and chloroplast genetic structure and diversity of oak parkland populations. We assembled the chloroplast genomes and matched these to restriction enzyme fragment chloroplast haplotypes found in previous studies of ancient woodlands. We found over two million high-quality nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), allowing us to identify 360 Q. robur, 10 Q. petraea and 16 hybrid individuals with confidence. We identified 81 coding regions exhibiting strong differentiation between the two species. We found evidence for selective sweeps in Q. robur near some regions containing genes with putative involvement in stress tolerance. We detected a few very close relatives within some sites, suggesting natural regeneration or local seed planting. There was little differentiation among the Q. robur populations at the four sites. Chloroplast genomes found in each parkland tended to be similar to those of local ancient woodlands, suggesting that they were derived from local seed sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EDNPT5E3/Nocchi et al. - 2022 - Genomic structure and diversity of oak populations.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10229,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppp3.10229,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/PDRWM5T4

Although there is compelling evidence that seeds and seedlings die from conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) as predicted by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, characterising adult recruitment remains a challenge for long-living trees. Previous studies have used the decrease in fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) across life stages to indicate CNDD; however, this has not been tested rigorously. We addressed these challenges by integrating dispersal kernels and FSGS. To establish links between density dependence and FSGS, we simulated seedlings based on the estimated dispersal kernels from parentage analyses, and further simulated adults under various seedling-to-adult recruitment scenarios, using an individual-based spatially explicit model. We tested this method in an isolated Cyclobalanopsis glauca population on China's Dajinshan Island. We detected significant FSGS in the seedlings and weaker, though also significant, FSGS in the adults. As expected, the observed FSGS of seedlings was well predicted by the simulated seedlings, with observations falling inside the 95% confidence envelopes over all distance classes. However, the simulations showed that CNDD enhanced the FSGS while positive density dependence dampened it during the seedling-to-adult transition. The adult FSGS of our population was therefore explained by positive rather than negative density-dependent adult recruitment. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the change of FSGS in conjunction with dispersal-based model tests can offer a valuable insight into density-dependent adult recruitment. The results indicate that the transitions from seedlings to adults in C. glauca are dominantly regulated not by Janzen–Connell effects, but by processes of positive density dependence. More broadly, the findings may provide a caution against extrapolations of widespread Janzen–Connell effects in seeds and seedlings to adult recruits, underscoring a critical gap between mechanisms at early stages and long-term population and community dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,2021,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EBNSND7A/Tong et al. - 2021 - Genetic tracking of density-dependent adult recrui.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13639,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.13639,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/IG2X56XV

Conservation of imperiled plant species can benefit from ex situ collections, including the living collections of botanic gardens and arboreta.

We apply microsatellite genotyping to Q. hinckleyi sampled from plants growing in ex situ collections (N = 22 , from nine gardens) and compare the results with genetic studies of the in situ population. We compare allelic diversity, genotypic diversity, and population structure. Pivotal results. The ex situ metacollection is small but has high allelic diversity and captures about 57% of the allelic diversity of the wild population. Ex situ plants contain 22 new alleles that contribute 13% of the species' total allelic diversity. All ex situ individuals have unique genotypes, none of which were found in situ, and thus they comprise 15% of the species' genotypic variation. The ex situ plants align with only one of three genetic clusters identified in situ, demonstrating an important gap in the ex situ metacollection. Conclusions. The ex situ collection of Q. hinckleyi , while small, is genetically diverse and provides additional allelic and genotypic diversity not currently existing in situ.

Combining 102 newly sequenced samples with publically available plastomes, we analyzed a dataset including 256 species and 32 of the 34 total genera of Fagales, representing the largest plastome-based study of the order to date. We find strong support for a sister relationship between Myricaceae and Juglandaceae, as well as strongly supported conflicting signal for alternative generic relationships in Betulaceae and Juglandaceae. These conflicts highlight the sensitivity of plastid phylogenomic analyses to genic composition, perhaps due to the prevalence of uninformative loci and heterogeneity in signal across different regions of the plastome. Phylogenetic relationships were geographically structured in subfamily Quercoideae, with Quercus being non-monophyletic and its sections forming clades with co-distributed Old World or New World genera of Quercoideae.

High genetic diversity is critical for the long-term viability of restored forests. However, there is limited knowledge of whether planted populations capture a genetic variation comparable to natural populations. We measured the efficiency of two forest restoration strategies using the common tropical oak Quercus bambusifolia. The multi-seedlot planting was established over ten years by collecting seeds from several locations in fragmented secondary forests of Hong Kong, while the single seedlot planting was established in just one year with seeds from a single natural location. We analysed the genetic diversity and genetic structure from both plantings and compared them with natural populations.

The low genetic diversity of such edge populations is predicted to have resulted from genetic drift and reduced gene flow when compared to core populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of genetic diversity of marginal-edge populations of Quercus gilva, restricted to a few habitats on Jeju Island, and compared them with the southern Kyushu populations. We also evaluated their evolutionary potential and conservation value. The genetic diversity and structure were analyzed using 40 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed in this study. Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) has been employed to develop our insights, which can be inferred from historical distribution changes. Contrary to our expectations, we detected a similar level of genetic diversity in the Jeju populations, comparable to that of the southern Kyushu populations, which have been regarded as long-term glacial refugia with a high genetic variability of East Asian evergreen trees. We found no signatures of recent bottlenecks in the Jeju populations. The results of STRUCTURE, neighbor-joining phylogeny, and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with a significant barrier clearly demonstrated that the Jeju and Kyushu regions are genetically distinct. However, ENM showed that the probability value for the distribution of the trees on Jeju Island during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) converge was zero. In consideration of these results, we hypothesize that independent massive postglacial colonization from a separate large genetic source, other than Kyushu, could have led to the current genetic diversity of Jeju Island. Therefore, we suggest that the Jeju populations deserve to be separately managed and designated as a level of management unit (MU).

Interspecific gene flow may play a key role in species adaptation to environmental change, as well as in the survival of endangered populations. Despite the fact that hybridization is quite common in plants, many hybridizing species, such as <italic>Quercus</italic> spp., maintain their integrity, while precise determination of genomic boundaries between species remains elusive. Novel high throughput sequencing techniques have opened up new perspectives in the comparative analysis of genomes and in the study of historical and current interspecific gene flow. In this work, we applied ddRADseq technique and developed an <italic>ad hoc</italic> bioinformatics pipeline for the study of ongoing hybridization between two relevant Mediterranean oaks, <italic>Q. ilex</italic> and <italic>Q. suber</italic>. We adopted a local scale approach, analyzing adult hybrids (<italic>sensu lato</italic>) identified in a mixed stand and their open-pollinated progenies. We have identified up to 9,251 markers across the genome and have estimated individual introgression levels in adults and seedlings. Estimated contribution of <italic>Q. suber</italic> to the genome is higher, on average, in hybrid progenies than in hybrid adults, suggesting preferential backcrossing with this parental species, maybe followed by selection during juvenile stages against individuals with higher <italic>Q. suber</italic> genomic contribution. Most discriminating markers seem to be scattered throughout the genome, suggesting that a large number of small genomic regions underlie boundaries between these species. In adult hybrids 273 markers (3%) showed allelic frequencies very similar to one of the parental species, and very different from the other; these loci could be relevant for understanding the hybridization process and the occurrence of adaptive introgression. Candidate marker databases developed in this study constitute a valuable resource to design large scale re-sequencing experiments in Mediterranean sclerophyllous oak species and could provide insight into species boundaries and adaptive introgression between <italic>Q. suber</italic> and <italic>Q. ilex</italic>.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,04/09/20,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/KY4WK3SZ/López de Heredia et al. - 2020 - ddRAD Sequencing-Based Identification of Genomic B.pdf,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.564414,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.564414/full,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/2DK4DAL4

Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification, probably in response to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity.

In this first study analysing and optimizing ex situ genetic diversity across multiple genera, we found that the percentage of extant genetic diversity currently conserved varies among taxa from 40% to 95%. Most taxa are well below genetic conservation targets. Resampling datasets showed that ideal collection sizes vary widely even within a genus: one taxon typically required at least 50% more individuals than another (though Quercus was an exception). Still, across taxa, the minimum collection size to achieve genetic conservation goals is within one order of magnitude. Current collections are also suboptimal: they could remain the same size yet capture twice the genetic diversity with an improved sampling design. We term this deficiency the ‘genetic conservation gap’. Lastly, we show that minimum collection sizes are influenced by collection priorities regarding the genetic diversity target.

A total of 36 populations of Q. castanea were genotyped with seven chloroplast microsatellite loci in four recognized biogeographic provinces of Mexico: the Sierra Madre Occidental (western mountain range), the Central Plateau, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB, mountain range crossing central Mexico from west to east) and the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS, southern mountain range). We obtained standard statistics of genetic diversity and structure and tested for signals of historical demographic expansions. A total of 90 haplotypes were identified, and 29 of these haplotypes were restricted to single populations. The within-population genetic diversity was high (mean hS = 0.72), and among-population genetic differentiation showed a strong phylogeographic structure (NST = 0.630 > GST = 0.266; p < .001). Signals of demographic expansion were identified in the TMVB and the SMS. The ecological niche models suggested a considerable percentage of stable distribution area for the species during the LGM and connectivity between the TMVB and the SMS.

In the present study, the cp genome of Q. bawanglingensis was sequenced and assembled into double-stranded circular DNA with a length of 161,394 bp. Two inverted repeats (IRs) with a total of 51,730 bp were identified, and the rest of the sequence was separated into two single-copy regions, namely, a large single-copy (LSC) region (90,628 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) region (19,036 bp). The genome of Q. bawanglingensis contains 134 genes (86 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNAs and eight rRNAs). More forward (29) than inverted long repeats (21) are distributed in the cp genome.

In this study, we explored the phylogeographic pattern of Quercus fabri, an endemic oak species in subtropical China, to assess the effects of past geographical and climatic changes on the evolutionary history of this deciduous species using three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM). The cpDNA fragments differentiated three phylogeographical groups among Q. fabri populations. A BEAST-derived chronogram based on the cpDNA haplotypes indicated that the initial divergence of Q. fabri probably occurred during the late Miocene (12.33 Ma), whereas haplotype divergence time could date back to the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene. ENM showed that the suitable areas contracted during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and expanded in the warm period during the Pleistocene. Consistently, both the cpDNA and ITS datasets suggested that population expansion occurred after the LGM period (ca. 13–14 kyr) for Q. fabri. Demographical analyses based on multiple genetic datasets and a coalescent-based method also suggested a shrinkage–expansion trend for the effective population sizes of Q. fabri during the glacial–interglacial periods in the Quaternary.

This group of four species inhabits a variety of soil types and exhibits varying patterns of species distribution ranging from widespread to restricted, with the range bisected by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB). Using chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites, we evaluated genetic diversity, diversification, and genetic group assignment across 49 populations. Chloroplast data identified 29 haplotypes in three distinct lineages, many of these found occurring on opposite sides of the TVB. Individual species were only loosely associated to specific chloroplast haplotypes but the distribution of shared haplotypes supports a one-time wider distribution. One lineage was highly divergent and geographically isolated, likely representing a case of chloroplast capture via hybridization and may indicate a range expansion of Racemiflorae into new territory. Nuclear gene diversity varied little across species and populations; however, differentiation and genetic assignment analysis was strongly structured geographically and tended to cluster with broad soil types. Soil specialist taxa produced homogeneous genetic structure while soil generalists showed varying patterns of mixed ancestry and high levels of admixture. Speciation appears driven by a combination of distance and edaphic factors leading to drift. Hybridization appears to be complementary, occurring most often in non-specific soil environments and in marginal areas, and contributes to a long-scale pattern of gene exchange as species ranges fluctuate with time.",,,,,,,,,,,,23/03/19,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TQ2BRELD/McCauley et al. - 2019 - Species diversification in a lineage of Mexican re.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-019-1333-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-019-1333-x,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/P45L5BPB

Oaks are known for limited barriers to gene flow among closely related species. Here, we use Quercus as a living laboratory in which to pursue a fundamental question in plant evolution: Do environmental gradients restrict or promote genetic exchange between species? Methods We focused on two North American oaks, the rare Quercus dumosa and the widespread Q. berberidifolia. We sampled intensively along a contact zone in California, USA. We sequenced restriction site-associated DNA markers and measured vegetative phenotype. We tested for genetic exchange, the association with climate, and the effect on phenotype. Results There is evidence for genetic exchange between the species. Admixed plants are found in areas of intermediate climate, while less admixed plants are found at the extremes of the climatic gradient. Genetic and phenotypic patterns are out of phase in the contact zone; some plants display the phenotype of one species but are genetically associated with another. Conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that a strong climatic gradient can promote genetic exchange between species. The overall weak correlation between genotype and phenotype in the contact zone between the species suggests that genetic exchange can lead to the breakdown of trait combinations used to define species.

However, the impact of the interaction between historical and current climatic variation and geological heterogeneity in the TMVB on the genetic and phenotypic diversification within oak species has been scarcely investigated. We used chloroplast DNA microsatellites and a geometric morphometrics analysis of leaf shape to understand differentiation between populations of Quercus deserticola Trel., which inhabits dry highlands along the TMVB. Ecological niche modeling for present-day conditions and projections into past scenarios were performed to evaluate the influence of environmental variables on the evolutionary history of the species. Results showed high genetic diversity ( hS = 0.774) and high genetic structure ( RST = 0.75) and the morphological subdivision of populations into two clusters, corresponding to the west/south and east/north sectors of the Q. deserticola geographic distribution. Ecological niche modeling indicated that the potential distribution of the species has remained similar from the late Pleistocene to the present. Seemingly, the phylogeographic structure of the species has been shaped by low seed-mediated gene flow and mostly local migration patterns. In turn, leaf shape is responding to climate differences either through phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation.

The two major American oak clades arose in what is now the boreal zone and radiated, in parallel, from eastern North America into Mexico and Central America. Oaks adapted rapidly to niche transitions.

Meanwhile, historical seed-mediated gene flow through the lower altitudinal distribution of Q. bumelioides may have promoted the homogenization of genetic variation.

Not only are they ubiquitous in our most common landscapes1 but they have also supplied human societies with invaluable services, including food and shelter, since prehistoric times2. With 450 species spread throughout Asia, Europe and America3, oaks constitute a critical global renewable resource. The longevity of oaks (several hundred years) probably underlies their emblematic cultural and historical importance. Such long-lived sessile organisms must persist in the face of a wide range of abiotic and biotic threats over their lifespans. We investigated the genomic features associated with such a long lifespan by sequencing, assembling and annotating the oak genome. We then used the growing number of whole-genome sequences for plants (including tree and herbaceous species) to investigate the parallel evolution of genomic characteristics potentially underpinning tree longevity. A further consequence of the long lifespan of trees is their accumulation of somatic mutations during mitotic divisions of stem cells present in the shoot apical meristems. Empirical4 and modelling5 approaches have shown that intra-organismal genetic heterogeneity can be selected for6 and provides direct fitness benefits in the arms race with short-lived pests and pathogens through a patchwork of intra-organismal phenotypes7. However, there is no clear proof that large-statured trees consist of a genetic mosaic of clonally distinct cell lineages within and between branches.

In this study, we reconstruct the first comprehensive phylogeny of this lineage using a genomic approach (restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, RAD-seq), sampling 35 of the ca. 90 species currently recognized, representing all main morphological groups of section Cyclobalanopsis. In addition, 10 other species of Quercus and two outgroups were also sampled. Divergence times were estimated using a relaxed clock model and two fossil calibrations. Ancestral areas and dispersal routes were inferred using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model. The phylogeny of Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis demonstrates the section to be monophyletic, comprising two main lineages and six subclades that are well supported by anatomical traits. Biogeographical reconstructions indicate that the wide northern hemisphere distribution of Quercus was disrupted in the Late Eocene, leading to the main extant groups at about 33 Ma. The earliest divergences in section Cyclobalanopsis correspond to the phased uplift of the Himalayas and lateral extrusion of Indochina at the transition of the Oligocene and Miocene, where the highest rate of diversification occurred in the late Miocene. Dispersal from Sino-Himalaya and the Palaeotropics to Sino-Japan in the Miocene was facilitated by the increased intensity of East Asian summer monsoons and by the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum.

We consider the consequences of the diversification process in shaping trait evolution and assembly of oak-dominated communities throughout the continental United States (U.S.). Methods Within the U.S. oaks, we tested for phylogenetic and functional trait patterns at different spatial scales, taking advantage of a dated phylogenomic analysis of American oaks and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). Key Results We find (1) phylogenetic overdispersion at small grain sizes throughout the U.S. across all spatial extents and (2) a shift from overdispersion to clustering with increasing grain sizes. Leaf traits have evolved in a convergent manner, and these traits are clustered in communities at all spatial scales, except in the far west, where species with contrasting leaf types co-occur. Conclusions Our results support the hypotheses that (1) interspecific interactions were important in parallel adaptive radiation of the genus into a range of habitats across the continent and (2) that the diversification process is a critical driver of community assembly. Functional convergence of complementary species from distinct clades adapted to the same local habitats is a likely mechanism that allows distantly related species to coexist.

Zonation patterns of species within mountains have been well documented, and shifts in these patterns have been correlated with recent warming. However, the physiological mechanisms that explain these zonation patterns are not well understood. We used a system of broadly sympatric oak species within semi-arid mountains to (1) investigate the extent to which species elevation ranges correlate with climate, (2) test for associations of cold and drought resistances with upper and lower elevation limits, and for trade-offs between resistance mechanisms with elevation, and (3) examine the extent to which species-wide climatic ranges predict traits that drive local community assembly along an elevation gradient. We found that aridity gradients but not winter minimum temperatures predict oak stratification. Species differed in drought resistance, demonstrating a trade-off between drought avoidance and drought recovery. At lower elevations, species avoided drought stress during the dry season through leaf abscission; at upper elevations, they maintained transpiration but recovered from daily desiccation via higher leaf water storage capacity, rather than tolerating desiccation via lower turgor loss points. Freezing resistance, measured as stem electrolyte leakage, was not correlated with elevation differences. Taken together, these results indicate that elevation stratification is linked to drought resistance rather than freezing resistance. We also found evidence of niche partitioning among closely related oaks linked to contrasting leaf phenology. The functional, phenological, and physiological traits important for elevation stratification were correlated with species’ range-wide mean annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality, but not aridity. Our findings indicate that drought resistance along a leaf avoidance–recovery trade-off is integral to species stratification within this semi-arid montane system. Additionally, the mechanism of stratification acts upon traits and strategies conserved at the species level.

We seek to elucidate the evolutionary history of the red oaks of the CA-FP, the Agrifoliae. METHODS: We collected PstI-associated RAD-seq data as well as morphometrics from individuals of the four species across their ranges, including varieties and hybrids. Phylogeny and divergence times were estimated. We analyzed morphological differentiation in over 70 plants using PCA and assessed species delimitation and admixture using genotype clustering analysis in over 40 plants. KEY RESULTS: We find that the Agrifoliae are monophyletic and sister to all other red oak species. Within the Agrifoliae, all species are supported, with Quercus kelloggii sister to a clade of subevergreen taxa: (Quercus agrifolia – (Q. parvula + Q. wislizeni)). Molecular and morphometric analyses are equivocal for named varieties. Notably, Q. parvula var. tamalpaisensis appears to be part of a hybrid swarm between Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni. Dating estimates were concordant with previous hypotheses and geological evidence, with diversification occurring between 10 and 20 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: The Agrifoliae represent a geographically discrete, early-diverging red oak lineage that diversified during the period of drying and warming associated with Sierran uplift during the middle Miocene.

Mountain uplifts are known to catalyse species radiation but their impact on evolutionarily stable taxa such as many trees remains little understood. The oak Quercus aquifolioides is endemic to yet widely distributed across the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in the Eastern Himalayas. Here, we investigate how the region's Neogene and Quaternary history has driven the species past population dynamics and the resulting extant patterns of intraspecifk diversity. Location: Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in SW China. Methods: We sampled 58 populations throughout the species range and genotyped a total of 959 individuals at four chloroplast DNA fragments and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. Phylogenetic reconstructions, molecular dating techniques and ancestral area reconstructions were used in combination with population genetic statistics to infer the biogeographical history of Q. aquifolioides. The phylogeographical study was complemented by a survey of fossil records and a niche modelling exercise. Results: Combined molecular and fossil evidence indicates that Q. aquifolioides descended during the late Miocene from the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into Tibet and the western Sichuan Plateau, and from there, into the area of highest endemism in the Hengduan Mountains sensu lato. Great apparent population stability and a haplotype 'radiation' in this area contrasted with marked extinction-recolonization dynamics and reduced population diversity in Tibet. We found evidence for extremely limited seed gene flow but extensive pollen gene flow (global FST: cpDNA = 0.98, nSSR = 0.07) with signals of asymmetric pollen dispersal from the Hengduan Mountains into Tibet.

RESULTS: The top 5% of FST estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.68, yielding loci potentially under spatially divergent selection. Environmental analyses of SNP frequencies with climate gradients revealed three significantly correlated SNPs within budburst/flowering genes and two SNPs within temperature stress genes with mean annual precipitation, after controlling for multiple testing. A redundancy model showed a significant association between SNPs and climate variables and revealed a similar set of SNPs with high loadings on the first axis. In the RDA, climate accounted for 67% of the explained variation, when holding climate constant, in contrast to a putatively neutral SSR data set where climate accounted for only 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Population differentiation and geographic gradients of allele frequencies in climate-associated functional genes in Q. lobata provide initial evidence of adaptive genetic variation and background for predicting population response to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,2016,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/JWPGLMTC/Sork et al. - 2016 - Landscape genomic analysis of candidate genes for .pdf,https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1500162,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.1500162,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/CEYBC5ZH

Because most phylogeographic studies have used neutral markers, the role of selection may have been undervalued. In this paper, we contend that plants provide a useful evolutionary lesson about the impact of selection on spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation, when the environment affects which individuals can colonize new sites, and on adaptive genetic variation, when environmental heterogeneity creates divergence at specific loci underlying local adaptation. Specifically, we discuss five characteristics found in plants that intensify the impact of selection: sessile growth form, high reproductive output, leptokurtic dispersal, isolation by environment, and the potential to evolve longevity. Collectively, these traits exacerbate the impact of environment on movement between populations and local selection pressures—both of which influence phylogeographic structure. We illustrate how these unique traits shape these processes with case studies of the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata, and the western North American lichen, Ramalina menziesii. Obviously, the lessons we learn from plant traits are not unique to plants, but they highlight the need for future animal, plant, and microbe studies to incorporate its impact.

In this study, we used chloroplast (cpDNA) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences to investigate genetic divergence patterns and demographic history of five of the six known populations of Q. arbutifolia. Considering its small population size and fragmentation, Q. arbutifolia has unexpectedly high genetic diversity. The time since the most recent common ancestor of all cpDNA haplotypes was c. 10.25 Ma, and the rapid diversification of haplotypes occurred during the Quaternary. The maximum clade credibility chronogram of cpDNA haplotypes suggests that the DM population (Daming Mountain, Guangxi province) diverged early and rapidly became isolated from other populations. The Pearl River drainage system may have been the main geographic barrier between DM and other populations since the late Miocene. ITS data suggests that population expansion occurred during the last interglacial of the Quaternary. The combined effects of pre-Quaternary and Quaternary climatic and geological changes were the main drivers to the current genetic diversity and distribution pattern of Q. arbutifolia.

A chromosome complement of 2n = 2x = 24 was confirmed in 21 species, and ascribed to Quercus phellos. Silver nitrate staining detected one or two nucleoli per nucleus, and two nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) per prometaphase cells. FISH performed with rDNA probes revealed two 5S and four 35S rDNA loci in nine species and confirmed their location in the remaining. Since no cytogenetic polymorphisms were detected, the IGS was studied. A single amplicon with ca. 2 kb was amplified in all oaks, and digested with six restriction enzymes, that produced a total of 125 IGS PCR–RFLP fragments with 99.2 % of polymorphism. A monomorphic HaeIII fragment with 225 bp was found. Among the infrageneric groups, 11 monomorphic bands were observed and 6 were considered group-specific.

(holm oak) is a wind-pollinated, sclerophyllous tree that copes with the environmental variability of the Mediterranean climate and that displays flexible ecophysiological adaptability in relation to hydric and thermic stresses. The holm oak dominates Mediterranean woodlands on both acidic and calcareous soils and has been exposed to management (dehesas) for thousands of years. Both protected areas and glacial refugia are supposed to preserve a substantial fraction of the genetic diversity of Iberian species. Genetic diversity was examined for 68 populations sampled throughout Spain using ptDNA SNPs, ptDNA microsatellites, and primarily nuclear AFLPs. Protected populations did not significantly differ from nonprotected populations by any of the measures of levels of genetic diversity. The three-level hierarchical AMOVA indicated that a low number of protected populations harbor most of the species’ genetic diversity. In addition, we found no evidence from either ptDNA or AFLP variation to support that populations from putative glacial refugia are divergent genetic groups as expected during isolation. Outcrossing, anemophilous long-distance pollen dispersal, acorn transport by animals, tree reliance, and habitat availability in Spain probably played a primarily role in homogenizing allele frequency among populations. This result leads us to suggest that extensive gene flow has been prevalent across Spanish populations. We conclude that glacial refugia have not been essential to maintain the neutral genetic makeup of Q. ilex. Nevertheless, conservation of the holm oak in protected areas ensures protection of the species’ genetic diversity, the most widespread woodland ecosystem in Iberia and indirectly the four iconic, endangered animal species (black stork, cinereous vulture, Iberian lynx, western imperial eagle).",,,,,,,,,,,,03/11/15,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/V5PKW2JC/Guzmán et al. - 2015 - Protected areas of Spain preserve the neutral gene.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-015-0950-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-015-0950-2,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/BNITYEPQ

However, hybridization may also beneficial for rare species by increasing their genetic variation and adaptive potential. Quercus austrocochinchinensis is an endangered oak species that overlaps geographically with the common, widespread Q. kerrii. Morphological intermediates are common in contact zones between the species, suggesting interspecific hybridization. This phenomenon may lead to pure Q. austrocochinchinensis facing a larger threat. Given the importance of leaf morphology for hybrid identification in oaks, we characterized leaf morphological and anatomical features of pure populations of Q. kerrii and Q. austrocochinchinensis and a population of probable hybrids at the contact zone. The results demonstrate that (1) leaf morphological features of putative hybrids are stable and distinct from the parental taxa, and more similar to those of Q. kerrii; (2) anticlinal wall patterns of abaxial epidermal cells show the most significant differences between parental species and probable hybrids, providing an important character for species identification; and (3) putative hybrids were intermediate in leaf anatomical features between the two parental species.

Fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) investigations provide a way to examine the spatial arrangement of genetic variation within populations. SGS can result from restricted seed and pollen dispersal and might be affected by geographic isolation and environmental changes and disturbances even in outcrossing wind-pollinated species like oaks. Studying the SGS of peripheral populations provides information that can be used to develop improved conservation and management plans at the species’ range edge. We assessed the level of genetic variation and SGS in twelve range edge populations in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (USA): eight Quercus rubra and four Quercus ellipsoidalis populations that were subject to different management regimes and natural disturbances. In contrast to Q. rubra populations, the drought tolerant Q. ellipsoidalis populations are isolated from the species’ main distribution range. These populations are not actively managed but are  especially prone to recurring fire events. The four managed and four old growth (“unmanaged”) Q. rubra populations displayed similar levels of genetic variation. Likewise the Sp statistic showed similar SGS levels in managed and unmanaged Q. rubra populations (Sp = 0.005) comparable to other Quercus species (European Q. robur: Sp = 0.003). Q. ellipsoidalis populations showed similar or more pronounced SGS than neighboring Q. rubra populations extending up to 83 m in one population. A significant excess of homozygotes across markers in two of the Q. ellipsoidalis populations suggests potential inbreeding. In summary, diverse management activities combined with various natural disturbances are likely both influencing SGS patterns.

Here, we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23–33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics, we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides, constituting 27,727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs, with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates, which overlapped by only 43–64% in locus coverage. 17% (4,715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size, but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci—due, for example, to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting—are masked by the globally optimal tree.

Particularly in light-demanding tree species, which are characterized by a narrow recruitment window, conservation of genetic diversity during natural regeneration can be challenging in small forest stands. In this study, we investigated intergenerational transmission of genetic diversity in stands of the light-demanding tree species pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) by comparing genetic diversity between adults and recently established seedling cohorts (1–3years old) in four small stands of Q. robur (<4.5ha) that varied in tree density. We also quantified mating patterns and gene flow to investigate their role in shaping the genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of the studied populations. Because of the closed canopy cover of these stands, only recently established seedlings could be studied. When all stands were pooled, the adult cohort showed a slightly but significantly higher allelic richness (Ar) than the established seedling cohort (Ar=11.5 and 10.7, respectively). However, at the stand level, no significant negative effects on the genetic diversity of the offspring generation were found in the small and low-density forest stands. As expected, acorn dispersal resulting in seedling recruitment was restricted to a few meters from mother trees, resulting in significant small-scale spatial genetic structure in the offspring. Pollen inflow from outside the study plots varied strongly among stands, but all plots showed a significant correlated paternity (rp), with higher estimates of rp found in forest stands with lower effective population sizes (Ne) and lower tree densities. Given that high rp-levels may increase the probability of biparental inbreeding and may incur fitness costs in subsequent offspring generations, we recommend that in small scale forestry of Q. robur, Ne and tree densities should be sufficiently large to maintain genetic diversity over the long term. Allowing gene flow between tree populations through reducing the spatial isolation among forest stands, can help to increase Ne in small-scale silvicultural systems of pedunculate oak, but also in other species characterized by narrow recruitment windows.",,,,,,,,,,,,15/01/14,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/KYLIQM2X/S0378112713007147.html,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.027,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713007147,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/J9HPWLB5

In the last years, cork oak stands have been facing a significant decline, which may be aggravated by the climate changes that are predicted to occur within cork oak distribution range during this century. Under this scenario, the assessment of adaptive genetic variation is essential to understand how cork oak may cope with these threats and to delineate strategies for the management of its genetic resources. In this study, six candidate genes possibly significant for environmental adaptation were analysed in cork oak populations from its entire distribution range. Signatures of natural selection were investigated using population genetic statistics and environmental association tests under alternative scenarios of population genetic structure. Signals of balancing selection were detected in the putative non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (NPR1), involved in plant defence response against pathogens, in auxin response factor 16 (ARF16), a gene implicated in root development, in RAN3, also involved in developmental processes, and in glutamine synthetase nodule isozyme (GS), involved in nitrogen fixation.

Although the mean FST value was very low, patterns for isolation-by-distance were strong and significant. Results from Bayesian clustering and Monmonier’s algorithm indicated that populations are roughly partitioned from west (Korea and Kyushu) to east (Japanese Honshu). Therefore, the two divisions within this species are demographically independent and may have arisen due to past fragmentation. In considering the mixed genetic structure between Korea and Kyushu populations, and the higher levels of genetic diversity in mainland Korea relative to Honshu, we hypothesized that this species has been able to survive within Jeju Island and Kyushu.

While seed production is often used as a proxy for overall reproductive success, high mortality of seeds and the potential for trade-offs between seed number and quality draw this assumption into question. Parentage analyses of established seedlings can bring us one step closer to understanding the causes and consequences of variation in reproductive success. In this paper we demonstrate a new method for estimating individual seedling production and average percentage germination, using data from two mixed-species populations of red oaks (Quercus rubra, Q. velutina, Q. falcata, and Q. coccinea). We use these estimates to examine the distribution of female reproductive success and to test the relationship between seedling number and individual seed production, age, and growth rate. We show that both seed and seedling production are highly skewed, roughly conforming to zero-inflated lognormal distributions, rather than to the Poisson or negative-binomial distributions often assumed by population genetics analyses. While the number of established offspring is positively associated with mean annual seed production, a lower proportion of seeds from highly fecund individuals become seedlings. Our red oak populations also show evidence of trade-offs between growth rate and reproductive success. The high degree of inequality in seedling production shown here for red oaks, and by previous studies in other species, suggests that many trees may be more vulnerable to genetic drift than previously thought, if immigration in limited by fragmentation or other environmental changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,2012,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/SXD5LYWP/Moran y Clark - 2012 - Causes and consequences of unequal seedling produc.pdf,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/23213502,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/GP5SNGQH

Pollen dispersal in the example population was extensive, with an average father–mother distance of 178 m. Estimated seed dispersal distances at the piedmont site were substantially longer than previous estimates based on seed-trap data (average 128 m vs. 9.3 m), suggesting that, under some circumstances, oaks may be less dispersal-limited than is commonly thought, with a greater potential for range shifts in response to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,2011,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/V8MIGXAG/Moran y Clark - 2011 - Estimating seed and pollen movement in a monoeciou.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05019.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05019.x,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/8C95ILWR

We address our findings in the context of known historical oak distribution from pollen core data derived from previously published research. Location Oak–savanna ecosystems from southern Oregon, USA (core populations/non-glaciated range) northward to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (peripheral populations/glaciated range). Methods We genotyped 378 trees from 22 sites with five chloroplast and seven nuclear microsatellite loci. For both sets of markers, we estimated genetic diversity and differentiation using an analysis of molecular variance and generated Mantel correlograms to detect genetic and geographical distance correlations. For the nuclear markers, we also used a Bayesian approach to infer population substructure. Results There was a large degree of population differentiation revealed by six chloroplast haplotypes, with little (≤ 3) or no haplotype diversity within sites. Peripheral island locations shared the same, maternally inherited chloroplast haplotype, whereas locations in mainland Washington had greater haplotype diversity. In contrast, genetic diversity of the nuclear markers was high at all locations sampled. Populations clustered into two groups and were significantly positively correlated over large spatial scales (≤ 200 km), although allele richness decreased significantly with latitude. Population substructure was observed between core and peripheral populations because rare alleles were absent in peripheral localities and common allele frequencies differed. Main conclusions The observed pattern of chloroplast haplotype loss at the northern periphery suggests restricted seed dispersal events from mainland sites to peripheral islands. This pattern was unexpected, however, as refugial oak populations remained near the current post-glacial range even during the Last Glacial Maximum. Using nuclear markers, we found high within-population diversity and population differentiation only over large spatial scales, suggesting that pollen flow is relatively high among populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/225MLIKH/Marsico et al. - 2009 - Patterns of seed dispersal and pollen flow in Quer.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.02049.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.02049.x,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/QKW6DPIN

However, such genetic information is frequently lacking. Here the relevance of genetic surveys to develop efficient conservation strategies for such populations is illustrated using cork oak (Quercus suber) from Minorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) as a case study. Cork oak is highly endangered on the island, where no more than 67 individuals live in small, isolated stands in siliceous sites. As a consequence, it was recently granted protected status. • Methods Two Bayesian clustering approaches were used to analyse the genetic structure of the Minorcan population, on the basis of nuclear microsatellite data. The different groups within the island were also compared with additional island and continental populations surrounding Minorca. • Key Results Very high genetic diversity was found, with values comparable with those observed in continental parts of the species' range. Furthermore, the Minorcan oak stands were highly differentiated from one another and were genetically related to different continental populations of France and Spain. • Conclusions The high levels of genetic diversity and inter-stands differentiation make Minorcan cork oak eligible for specific conservation efforts. The relationship of Minorcan stands to different continental populations in France and Spain probably reflects multiple colonization events. However, discrepancy between chloroplast DNA- and nuclear DNA-based groups does not support a simple scenario of recent introduction. Gene exchanges between neighbouring cork oak stands and with holm oak have created specific and exceptional genetic combinations. They also constitute a wide range of potential genetic resources for research on adaptation to new environmental conditions.

Interspecies nuclear introgression was based on individual admixture rates using a Bayesian approach with no a priori species assignment, and on a maximum-likelihood (ML) method, using allele frequencies in the allopatric populations of each species as controls. Gene flow was compared specifically between populations located within and outside the specific areas.High interspecies nuclear genetic differentiation was observed, with twice the number of alleles in Q. ilex than in Q. suber. According to Bayesian assignment, approx. 1 % of individuals had a high probability of being F1 hybrids, and bidirectional nuclear introgression affected approx. 4 % of individuals in each species. Hybrid and introgressed individuals were identified predominantly in mixed stands and may have a recent origin. Higher proportions including allospecific genes recovered from past hybridization were obtained using the ML method. Similar rates of hybridization and of nuclear introgression, partially independent of cpDNA interspecies transfer suggestive of gene filtering, were obtained in the populations located within and outside the areas of complete cpDNA replacement.The results did not provide evidence for geographical variation in interspecies gene flow.

The community consists of five oak species: Q. robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and Q. frainetto - that are closely related -, and Q. cerris. A total of five chloroplast haplotypes was identified. Q. cerris was fixed for a single haplotype. The other four species shared the two most common haplotypes. One haplotype was confined to Q. robur and a very rare one was restricted to Q. petraea. Both types of nuclear markers revealed a larger genetic variation for Q. pubescens and Q. petraea than for Q. frainetto and Q. robur, although the differences between species are in most cases not significant. At the nuclear level, Q. cerris could be clearly separated from the other four oak species confirming the taxonomic classification. Regardless of the estimate used, the levels of polymorphism revealed by microsatellites were much higher than those based on isozymes. For the four closely related species the overall genetic differentiation was significant at both categories of nuclear markers. Several loci, such as Acp-C for isozymes, and ssrQpZAG36 and ssrQrZAG96 for microsatellites were very useful to discriminate among species.

However, these formations are under increasing threat due to the lack of regeneration. We have analysed spatial genetic structure in a mixed parkland; inferences about gene dispersal have also been performed, according to the isolation by distance model. Noticeable differences have been detected between the species, despite their similar ecological roles. Restricted effective dispersal leads to kin structures in cork oak, up to 70 m, while no genetic structure is observed in holm oak. Our results suggest a very effective dispersal for the latter, with a local historical gene flow estimated between 55 and 95 m. This is the first time regeneration of Mediterranean oak parklands has been assessed from a genetic perspective. Effective gene flow detected for holm oaks allows us to discount the risk of inbreeding over successive generations. Thus, regeneration of Q. ilex dehesas will just require action directed to help the settlement of the saplings (such as limiting grazing). However, in those cases where densities are too low, more intense forestation (such as plantation and/or establishment of appropriate shelter) will be needed. The ‘density threshold’ for initiating regeneration will probably be higher for cork oak, due to its more limited dispersal and minor full-light tolerance.",,,,,,,,,,,,2007-12,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TR9SV957/Soto et al. - 2007 - Differences in fine-scale genetic structure and di.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.6801007,https://www.nature.com/articles/6801007,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/NBGS7PN3

The goals of the present study are: (i) to compare the chloroplast genetic diversity found in one California oak species vs. that found in the extensively studied European oak species (in France and the Iberian Peninsula); (ii) to contrast the geographical structure of haplotypes between these two taxa and test for a phylogeographical structure for the California species. For this purpose, we used the same six maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and a similar sampling strategy. The haplotype diversity within site as well as the differentiation among sites was alike in both taxa, but the Californian species has higher allelic richness with a greater number of haplotypes (39 vs. 11 in the European white oak complex). Furthermore, in California these 39 haplotypes are distributed locally in patches while in the European oaks haplotypes are distributed into lineages partitioned longitudinally.

Biparental inbreeding is present (4.9%), but reduced, in the largest fragment. The average pollen neighborhood size (Nep = 5.1 to 6.1) appears comparable to other oak species in sparse landscapes. In contrast, Nu consists of 2 to 4 main donors, although up to 12 are possible, with the mode positively correlated with fragment size. The Andean oak appears to be a resilient species capable of tolerating population subdivision, provided landscapes include large fragments.",,,,,,,,,,,,01/11/05,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/QDQNJISU/Fernández-M. y Sork - 2005 - Mating Patterns of a Subdivided Population of the .pdf,https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi104,https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi104,https://zotero.org/elly_pc/items/2KGTB4T7

The study aimed to describe species distinction in Irish oak populations and to situate this in a European context.• Methods Populations were sampled from across the range of the island of Ireland. Leaf morphological characters were analysed through clustering and ordination methods. Putative neutral molecular markers (AFLPs) were used to analyse the molecular variation. Cluster and ordination analyses were also performed on the AFLP markers in addition to calculations of genetic diversity and F-statisitcs.• Key Results A notable divergence was uncovered between the morphological and molecular analyses. The morphological analysis clearly differentiated individuals into their respective species, whereas the molecular analysis did not. Twenty species-specific AFLP markers were observed from 123 plants in 24 populations but none of these was species-diagnostic. Principal Coordinate Analysis of the AFLP data revealed a clustering, across the first two axes, of individuals according to population rather than according to species. High FST values calculated from AFLP markers also indicated population differentiation (FST = 0·271). Species differentiation accounted for only 13 % of the variation in diversity compared with population differentiation, which accounted for 27 %.• Conclusions The results show that neutral molecular variation is partitioned more strongly between populations than between species. Although this could indicate that the populations of Q. petraea and Q. robur studied may not be distinct species at a molecular level, it is proposed that the difficulty in distinguishing the species in Irish oak populations using AFLP markers is due to population differentiation masking species differences. This could result from non-random mating in small, fragmented woodland populations.

A key issue is whether remnant individuals become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata) is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen donors (Nep) and average distance of effective pollen movement (δ). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current Nep = 3.68 individuals. Based on an average adult density of d= 1.19 stems/ha, we assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen dispersal distance (δ) and estimated δ= 64.8 m. We then deployed our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick population to evaluate the extent to which Nep may have changed, as a consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999. Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate Nep was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere.

This index is a new measure of the propensity of species to share locally genetic markers, varying from zero (complete differentiation) to one (no differentiation). By contrast, more closely related deciduous oak species (Q. robur, Q. petraea and Q. pubescens) have introgression ratios varying from 0.82 to 0.97. The introgression events appear to have been more frequent in the direction Q. ilex (female) × Q. suber (male), a finding which seems attributable to the flowering phenology of these two species.
