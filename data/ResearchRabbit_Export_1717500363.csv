10.3897/phytokeys.95.21126,29674926,,A taxonomic study of Quercus langbianensis complex based on morphology and DNA barcodes of classic and next generation sequences,"The taxonomy of Quercus langbianensis and its relatives in Vietnam and Cambodia have been revised based on evidence obtained from field observations, morphological comparison of herbarium specimens and molecular analyses using both classic and next generation DNA markers. Based on Bayesian inference using rbcL, matK and ITS regions and Neighbour-joining tree using genome-wide sequences amplified with multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers (MIG-seq), the authors recognised ten species in the complex in Vietnam and Cambodia, three of which are newly described in this paper: Q. baolamensissp. nov., Q. bidoupensissp. nov. and Q. honbaensissp. nov. These new species are all phenotypically similar to Q. langbianensiss. str. in having lanceolate to oblanceolate leaf shape, upper 4-5/6-serrated leaf margin, acute or acuminate leaf apex and bracts of cupule arranged in 5-9 rings but distinguished both morphologically and phylogenetically. In molecular phylogenetic reconstructions, Q. bidoupensis is not close to any other species. In the Bayesian tree, Q. honbaensis is sister to both Q. blaoensis and Q. camusiae that are found in the same locality but morphologically distinct and those three species are sister to Q. langbianensiss. str., while Quercus baolamensis is not sister to Q. langbianensiss. str. in both the Bayesian tree and MIG-seq tree. In addition, Q. cambodiensis and Q. baniensis previously reduced to Q. langbianensiss. lat. have been recognised as distinct species. Six species were in need of lectotypification and that is undertaken herein.","Hoàng Thị Bình,Hoang Thi Binh,Nguyễn Văn Ngọc,Nguyen Van Ngoc,Shuichiro Tagane,Shuichiro Tagane,Hironori Toyama,Hironori Toyama,Keiko Mase,Keiko Mase,Chika Mitsuyuki,Chika Mitsuyuki,Joeri S.

The new species is morphologically similar to Q. edithiae Skan, in having 8–11 pairs of secondary veins, bowl-shaped cupules and ellipsoid to cylindrical-ellipsoid and basally convex nuts. It differs in having serrulate leaf margins only at apical 1/5–1/7, almost entire margins of bracts on cupule and much longer nuts. The species is also similar to Q. fleuryi Hickel & A. Camus in having leaves glabrous on both surfaces with only an apically serrulate margin but differs in having shorter petioles, cupules enclosing 1/5 of the nut and much longer nuts.

10.3732/ajb.1500182,26672009,,Landscape genetics and population structure in Valley Oak (Quercus lobata Née),"Although long-distance pollen movement is common in wind-pollinated trees, barriers to gene flow may occur in species that have discontinuous ranges or are confined to certain habitat types. We investigated the genetic structure of Quercus lobata Nee populations throughout much of their range in California. We assessed the connectivity of populations and determined if barriers to gene flow occurred, and if so, if they corresponded to landscape features.We collected leaf samples from 270 trees from 12 stands of Quercus lobata and genotyped these trees using eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. Genetic structure and clustering was evaluated using genetic distance methods, Bayesian clustering approaches, and network analysis of spatial genetic structure.The southernmost population of Quercus lobata sampled from the Santa Monica area comprised a separate genetic cluster from the rest of the species, suggesting that Transverse Ranges such as the San Gabriel Mountains limit gene flow. Population differentiation among the other sites was small but significant. Network analysis reflected higher connectivity among populations along the Central Coast range, with few connections spanning the dry, low Central Valley.While long distance pollen movement has been shown to be common in oaks, on larger spatial scales, topographic features such as mountain ranges and the large, flat Central Valley of California limit gene flow. Such landscape features explain gene flow patterns much better than geographic distance alone.","Mary V. Ashley,Mary V. Ashley,Saji Abraham,Saji T. Abraham,Saji T.

10.1600/036364408783887320,,,Taxonomy of Hill's Oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis: Fagaceae): Evidence from AFLP Data,"Quercus ellipsoidalis (Hill's oak), an endemic of east-central North America, is morphologically similar to Q. coccinea (scarlet oak) and is subsumed into that species in several floristic treatments. This study uses data from more than 250 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to investigate whether Q. coccinea and Q. ellipsoidalis are genetically distinct from one another. Whereas Q. coccinea and Q. ellipsoidalis separate from one another in all analyses, Q. velutina (black oak) populations collected from the geographic range of both Q. coccinea and Q. ellipsoidalis do not separate out by geographic region. This, combined with the strong differentiation between Q. coccinea and Q. velutina but weak differentiation between Q. ellipsoidalis and Q. velutina, supports the view that Q. coccinea and Q. ellipsoidalis are not simply regional variants of a single taxon. Moreover, while there is no evidence from the molecular data we collected of hybridization between Q. coccinea and Q. ellipsoidalis, the data suggest that there may be gene flow between Q. ellipsoidalis and Q. velutina. A clearer understanding of the relationships among these taxa is essential to understanding the taxonomy of Quercus section Lobate in eastern North America.","Andrew L. Hipp,Andrew L. Hipp,Jaime A.

To avoid extinction, tree populations must tolerate, adapt, or migrate. Here we investigate geographic patterns of genetic variation in valley oak, Quercus lobata Nee, to assess how underlying geneticstructure of populations might influence thisspecies' ability to survive climatechange.First,tounderstandhowgeneticlineagesshapespatialgeneticpatterns,we examine historical patterns of colonization. Second, we examine the correlation between multivariate nuclear genetic variation and climatic variation. Third, to illustrate how geographic genetic variation could interact with regional patterns of 21st Century climate change, we produce region-specific bioclimatic distributions of valley oak using Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) models based on downscaled historical (1971-2000) and future (2070-2100) climate grids. Future climatologies are based on a moderate-high (A2) carbon emission scenario and two different global climate models. Chloroplast markers indicate historical range-wide connectivity via colonization, especially in the north. Multivariate nuclear genotypes show a strong association with climate variation that provides opportunity for local adaptation to the conditions within their climatic envelope. Comparison of regional current and projected patterns of climate suitability indicates that valley oaks grow in distinctly different climate conditions in different parts of their range. Our models predict widely different regional outcomes from local displacement of a few kilometres to hundreds of kilometres. We conclude that the relative importance of migration, adaptation, and tolerance are likely to vary widely for populations among regions, and that late 21st Century conditions could lead to regional extinctions.","Victoria L.

10.1111/mec.14869,30226013,,"RADseq data reveal ancient, but not pervasive, introgression between Californian tree and scrub oak species (Quercus sect. Quercus: Fagaceae).","A long-term debate in evolutionary biology is the extent to which reproductive isolation is a necessary element of speciation. Hybridizing plants in general are cited as evidence against this notion, and oaks specifically have been used as the classic example of species maintenance without reproductive isolation. Here, we use thousands of SNPs generated by RAD sequencing to describe the phylogeny of a set of sympatric white oak species in California and then test whether these species exhibit pervasive interspecific gene exchange. Using RAD sequencing, we first constructed a phylogeny of ten oak species found in California. Our phylogeny revealed that seven scrub oak taxa occur within one clade that diverged from a common ancestor with Q. lobata, that they comprise two subclades, and they are not monophyletic but include the widespread tree oak Q. douglasii. Next, we searched for genomic patterns of allele sharing consistent with gene flow between long-divergent tree oaks with scrub oaks. Specifically, we utilized the D-statistic as well as model-based inference to compare the signature of shared alleles between two focal tree species (Q. lobata and Q. engelmannii) with multiple scrub species within the two subclades. We found that introgression is not equally pervasive between sympatric tree and scrub oak species. Instead, gene flow commonly occurs from scrub oaks to recently sympatric Q. engelmannii, but less so from scrub oaks to long-sympatric Q. lobata. This case study illustrates the influence of ancient introgression and impact of reproductive isolating mechanisms in preventing indiscriminate interspecific gene exchange.","Bernard Kim,Bernard Y.

10.1016/j.jgg.2024.03.012,,,Chromosome-scale genomes of <i>Quercus sichourensis</i> and <i>Quercus rex</i> provide insights into the evolution and adaptation of <i>Fagaceae</i>,"The Fagaceae, a plant family with a wide distribution and diverse adaptability, has garnered significant interest as a subject of study in plant speciation and adaptation. Meanwhile, certain Fagaceae species are regarded as highly valuable wood resources due to the exceptional quality of their wood. In this study, we present two high-quality, chromosome-scale genome sequences for Quercus sichourensis (848.75 Mb) and Quercus rex (883.46 Mb). Comparative genomics analysis reveals that the difference in the number of plant disease resistance genes and the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution ratio (Ka/Ks) of protein-coding genes among Fagaceae species are related to different environmental adaptations. Interestingly, most genes related to starch synthesis in the investigated Quercoideae species are located on a single chromosome, as compared to the outgroup species, Fagus sylvatica. Furthermore, resequencing and population analysis of Q. sichourensis and Q. rex reveal that Q. sichourensis has lower genetic diversity and higher deleterious mutations compared to Q. rex. The high-quality, chromosome-level genomes and the population genomic analysis of the critically endangered Q. sichourensis and Q. rex will provide an invaluable resource as well as insights for future study in these two species, even the genus Quercus, to facilitate their conservation.","Xue Liu,Weixiong Zhang,Yongting Zhang,Jing Yang,Peng Zeng,Zunzhe Tian,Weibang Sun,Jing Cai",Journal of Genetics and Genomics,2024
10.3390/f13040579,,,"Genetic Diversity and Structure of Quercus hondae, a Rare Evergreen Oak Species in Southwestern Japan","Conservation of rare species is essential for maintaining ecosystem function. Quercus hondae is a rare evergreen oak species (Cyclobalanopsis) endemic to Japan. This species is found in several locations in Southwestern Japan; small populations remain in the tutelary forests of the Japanese shrine. To evaluate the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of this rare species, 11 microsatellite loci and chloroplast DNA sequences are analyzed for 12 populations of Q. hondae and 8 populations of the more widespread congeneric species, Q. glauca. It is found that heterozygosity at both the population and species level is substantially lower in Q. hondae than in Q. glauca. Genetic differentiation among populations of Q. hondae was high, in contrast to Q. glauca, in which populations exhibit largely insignificant differentiation. STRUCTURE analysis shows that at K = 7, the clusters largely corresponded to major predefined populations. This study suggests that there is little gene flow among extant Q. hondae populations and that Q. hondae is genetically differentiated due to the greater effect of genetic drift in small populations. This pattern is in sharp contrast to that of a more common congeneric species, which will be an important consideration in the conservation of Q. hondae.","Katsumasa Kamiya,Koichi Kamiya,Misato Ogasahara,Misato Ogasahara,Kenzö Tanaka,Tanaka Kenzo,Koji Muramoto,Koji Muramoto,Takuya Araki,Takuya Araki,Tomoaki Ichie,Tomoaki Ichie",Forests,2022

To understand the genomic features, phylogenetic relationships, and molecular evolution of Q. litseoides, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome was analyzed and compared in Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis. The cp genome of Q. litseoides was 160,782 bp in length, with an overall guanine and cytosine (GC) content of 36.9%. It contained 131 genes, including 86 protein-coding genes, eight ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 transfer RNA genes. A total of 165 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 48 long sequence repeats with A/T bias were identified in the Q. litseoides cp genome, which were mainly distributed in the large single copy region (LSC) and intergenic spacer regions. The Q. litseoides cp genome was similar in size, gene composition, and linearity of the structural region to those of Quercus species. The non-coding regions were more divergent than the coding regions, and the LSC region and small single copy region (SSC) were more divergent than the inverted repeat regions (IRs). Among the 13 divergent regions, 11 were in the LSC region, and only two were in the SSC region. Moreover, the coding sequence (CDS) of the six protein-coding genes (rps12, matK, atpF, rpoC2, rpoC1, and ndhK) were subjected to positive selection pressure when pairwise comparison of 16 species of Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis. A close relationship between Q. litseoides and Quercus edithiae was found in the phylogenetic analysis of cp genomes.

Our goal is to test whether climate-associated candidate genes show evidence of spatially divergent selection in natural populations of valley oak, Quercus lobata, as preliminary indication of local adaptation.Using DNA from 45 individuals from 13 localities across the species' range, we sequenced portions of 40 candidate genes related to budburst/flowering, growth, osmotic stress, and temperature stress. Using 195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimated genetic differentiation across populations and correlated allele frequencies with climate gradients using single-locus and multivariate models.The top 5% of FST estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.68, yielding loci potentially under spatially divergent selection. Environmental analyses of SNP frequencies with climate gradients revealed three significantly correlated SNPs within budburst/flowering genes and two SNPs within temperature stress genes with mean annual precipitation, after controlling for multiple testing. A redundancy model showed a significant association between SNPs and climate variables and revealed a similar set of SNPs with high loadings on the first axis. In the RDA, climate accounted for 67% of the explained variation, when holding climate constant, in contrast to a putatively neutral SSR data set where climate accounted for only 33%.Population differentiation and geographic gradients of allele frequencies in climate-associated functional genes in Q. lobata provide initial evidence of adaptive genetic variation and background for predicting population response to climate change.","Victoria L.

10.3732/ajb.1600259,27999079,,Evolutionary history and gene flow of an endemic island oak: Quercus pacifica.,"Premise of the study: Understanding historical patterns of colonization and subsequent gene

flow clarifies the evolutionary origins and history of endemic island species.

Methods: Here we use DNA microsatellite markers to characterize the genetic structure of

the island endemic species Quercus pacifica K. Nixon & C.H. Muller, found on three of the

California Channel Islands, and to examine its relationship to two mainland oaks, Q.

berberidifolia and Q. dumosa.

Key results: We found that Q. pacifica is a genetically cohesive and differentiated

evolutionary lineage, diverging from mainland scrub oaks in the Pleistocene with little

subsequent introgression. Genetic differentiation of Q. pacifica among islands is small but

significant. Both recent and historical gene flow was surprisingly high considering the disjunct

distribution of Q. pacifica on islands separated by as much as 125 km of open ocean. Gene flow

estimates were highest between the two northern islands and from the northern islands to Santa

Catalina. While there is no evidence of recent bottlenecks, historical bottlenecks are indicated on

each of the islands.

Conclusions: The genetic cohesiveness of the Q. pacifica species suggests allopatric

speciation on the islands with subsequent gene flow that has maintained genetic continuity over

great distances.","Janet Rizner Backs,Janet Rizner Backs,Mary V. Ashley,Mary V. Ashley",American Journal of Botany,2016

We seek to elucidate the evolutionary history of the red oaks of the CA-FP, the Agrifoliae. METHODS: We collected PstI-associated RAD-seq data as well as morphometrics from individuals of the four species across their ranges, including varieties and hybrids. Phylogeny and divergence times were estimated. We analyzed morphological differentiation in over 70 plants using PCA and assessed species delimitation and admixture using genotype clustering analysis in over 40 plants. KEY RESULTS: We find that the Agrifoliae are monophyletic and sister to all other red oak species. Within the Agrifoliae, all species are supported, with Quercus kelloggii sister to a clade of subevergreen taxa: (Quercus agrifolia - (Q. parvula + Q. wislizeni)). Molecular and morphometric analyses are equivocal for named varieties. Notably, Q. parvula var. tamalpaisensis appears to be part of a hybrid swarm between Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni. Dating estimates were concordant with previous hypotheses and geological evidence, with diversification occurring between 10 and 20 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: The Agrifoliae represent a geographically discrete, early-diverging red oak lineage that diversified during the period of drying and warming associated with Sierran uplift during the middle Miocene. Molecular differentiation within the clade supports the current taxonomy, including an east-west species level pattern (Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni) and north-south intraspecific patterns to some degree, although the latter require additional study.","Duncan Hauser,Duncan A.

10.3390/f12050561,,,Comparing Genetic Diversity in Three Threatened Oaks,"Genetic diversity is a critical resource for species’ survival during times of environmental change. Conserving and sustainably managing genetic diversity requires understanding the distribution and amount of genetic diversity (in situ and ex situ) across multiple species. This paper focuses on three emblematic and IUCN Red List threatened oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae), a highly speciose tree genus that contains numerous rare species and poses challenges for ex situ conservation. We compare the genetic diversity of three rare oak species—Quercus georgiana, Q. oglethorpensis, and Q. boyntonii—to common oaks; investigate the correlation of range size, population size, and the abiotic environment with genetic diversity within and among populations in situ; and test how well genetic diversity preserved in botanic gardens correlates with geographic range size. Our main findings are: (1) these three rare species generally have lower genetic diversity than more abundant oaks; (2) in some cases, small population size and geographic range correlate with genetic diversity and differentiation; and (3) genetic diversity currently protected in botanic gardens is inadequately predicted by geographic range size and number of samples preserved, suggesting non-random sampling of populations for conservation collections. Our results highlight that most populations of these three rare oaks have managed to avoid severe genetic erosion, but their small size will likely necessitate genetic management going forward.","Emma Spence,Emma Spence,Jeremie B.

Here, we studied Quercus havardii Rydb., a uniquely adapted desert oak endemic to the Southwest region of the United States, using genetic, morphometric, and environmental datasets over various geographic scales to quantify differentiation and understand forces influencing population divergence. First, we quantified variation by analyzing 10 eastern and 13 western populations from the disjunct distribution of Q. havardii using 11 microsatellite loci, 17 morphological variables, and 19 bioclimatic variables. We then used regressions to examine local and regional correlations of climate with genetic variation. We found strong genetic, morphological and environmental differences corresponding with the large-scale disjunction of populations. Additionally, western populations had higher genetic diversity and lower relatedness than eastern populations. Levels of genetic variation in the eastern populations were found to be primarily associated with precipitation seasonality, while levels of genetic variation in western populations were associated with lower daily temperature fluctuations and higher winter precipitation. Finally, we found little to no observed environmental niche overlap between regions. Our results suggest that eastern and western populations likely represent two distinct taxonomic entities, each associated with a unique set of climatic variables potentially influencing local patterns of diversity.","Bethany A.

No chloroplast (cp) genome information is currently available for Q. bawanglingensis, which would be essential for the establishment of guidelines for its conservation and breeding. In the present study, the cp genome of Q. bawanglingensis was sequenced and assembled into double-stranded circular DNA with a length of 161,394 bp. Two inverted repeats (IRs) with a total of 51,730 bp were identified, and the rest of the sequence was separated into two single-copy regions, namely, a large single-copy (LSC) region (90,628 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) region (19,036 bp). The genome of Q. bawanglingensis contains 134 genes (86 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNAs and eight rRNAs). More forward (29) than inverted long repeats (21) are distributed in the cp genome. A simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis showed that the genome contains 82 SSR loci, involving 84.15% A/T mononucleotides.

Quercus austrocochinchinensis and Q. kerrii (subgenus Cyclobalanopsis) are a pair of closely related species in the Indo-China area. Morphological intermediates of the two species have been reported in this region. In this study, we used AFLP, SSR and two key leaf morphological diagnostic traits to study the two Q. austrocochinchinensis populations, two pure Q. kerrii and two putative hybrid populations in China. Rates of individual admixture were examined using the Bayesian clustering programs STRUCTURE and NewHybrids, with no a priori species assignment. In total, we obtained 151 SSR alleles and 781 polymorphic loci of AFLP markers. Population differentiation inferred by SSR and AFLP was incoherent with recognized species boundaries. Bayesian admixture analyses and principal coordinate analysis identified more hybrids and backcrossed individuals than morphological intermediates in the populations. SSR inferred a wide genetic assimilation in Q. austrocochinchinensis, except for subpopulation D2 in the core area of Xi-Shuang-Ban-Na Nature Reserve (XSBN). However, AFLP recognized more Q. austrocochinchinensis purebreds than SSR. Analysis using NewHybrids on AFLP data indicated that these hybridized individuals were few F2 and predominantly backcrosses with both parental species. All these evidences indicate the formation of a hybrid swarm at XSBN where the two species co-exist. Both AFLP and SSR recognized that the core protected area of XSBN (D2) has a high percentage of Q. austrocochinchinensis purebreds and a unique germplasm. The Hainan population and the other subpopulations of XSBN of the species might have lost their genetic integrity. Our results revealed a clear genetic differentiation in the populations and subpopulations of Q. austrocochinchinensis and ongoing introgression between Q. austrocochinchinensis and Q. kerrii at the disturbed contact areas. Combining the results from genetic and morphological analyses, the conservation of subpopulation D2 should be prioritized. Conservation and restoration of the integrity of tropical ravine rainforest is an important long-term goal for the successful conservation of Q. austrocochinchinensis.

The k-mer histograms indicate an diploid genome size of ∼720–730 Mb, which is smaller than the total length due to high heterozygosity, estimated at 1.25%. A comparison with a recently published European oak (Q. robur) nuclear sequence indicates 93% similarity. The Q. lobata chloroplast genome has 99% identity with another North American oak, Q. rubra. Preliminary annotation yielded an estimate of 61,773 predicted protein-coding genes, of which 71% had similarity to known protein domains. We searched 956 Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs, and found 863 complete orthologs, of which 450 were present in >1 copy. We also examined an earlier version (v0.5) where duplicate haplotypes were removed to discover variants. These additional sources indicate that the predicted gene count in Version 1.0 is overestimated by 37–52%. Nonetheless, this first draft valley oak genome assembly represents a high-quality, well-annotated genome that provides a tool for forest restoration and management practices.","Victoria L.

10.1371/journal.pone.0093975,24705617,,A Framework Phylogeny of the American Oak Clade Based on Sequenced RAD Data,"Previous phylogenetic studies in oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae) have failed to resolve the backbone topology of the genus with strong support. Here, we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23–33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics, we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides, constituting 27,727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs, with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates, which overlapped by only 43–64% in locus coverage. 17% (4,715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size, but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci—due, for example, to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting—are masked by the globally optimal tree. We find no evidence for strongly-supported alternative topologies in our study, suggesting that the phylogeny we recover is a robust estimate of large-scale phylogenetic patterns in the American oak clade. Our study is one of the first to demonstrate the utility of RAD-Seq data for inferring phylogeny in a 23–33 million year-old clade.","Andrew L. Hipp,Andrew L. Hipp,Deren A. R. Eaton,Deren A. R.

10.1186/s12864-017-3765-8,28558688,,High-quality genetic mapping with ddRADseq in the non-model tree Quercus rubra.,"Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) has the potential to be a broadly applicable, low-cost approach for high-quality genetic linkage mapping in forest trees lacking a reference genome. The statistical inference of linear order must be as accurate as possible for the correct ordering of sequence scaffolds and contigs to chromosomal locations. Accurate maps also facilitate the discovery of chromosome segments containing allelic variants conferring resistance to the biotic and abiotic stresses that threaten forest trees worldwide. We used ddRADseq for genetic mapping in the tree Quercus rubra, with an approach optimized to produce a high-quality map. Our study design also enabled us to model the results we would have obtained with less depth of coverage. Our sequencing design produced a high sequencing depth in the parents (248×) and a moderate sequencing depth (15×) in the progeny. The digital normalization method of generating a de novo reference and the SAMtools SNP variant caller yielded the most SNP calls (78,725). The major drivers of map inflation were multiple SNPs located within the same sequence (77% of SNPs called). The highest quality map was generated with a low level of missing data (5%) and a genome-wide threshold of 0.025 for deviation from Mendelian expectation. The final map included 849 SNP markers (1.8% of the 78,725 SNPs called). Downsampling the individual FASTQ files to model lower depth of coverage revealed that sequencing the progeny using 96 samples per lane would have yielded too few SNP markers to generate a map, even if we had sequenced the parents at depth 248×. The ddRADseq technology produced enough high-quality SNP markers to make a moderately dense, high-quality map. The success of this project was due to high depth of coverage of the parents, moderate depth of coverage of the progeny, a good framework map, an optimized bioinformatics pipeline, and rigorous premapping filters. The ddRADseq approach is useful for the construction of high-quality genetic maps in organisms lacking a reference genome if the parents and progeny are sequenced at sufficient depth. Technical improvements in reduced representation sequencing (RRS) approaches are needed to reduce the amount of missing data.","Arpita Konar,Arpita Konar,Olivia Choudhury,Olivia Choudhury,Rebecca Bullis,Rebecca Bullis,L.

10.1186/s12863-018-0677-9,,,Assessment of shared alleles in drought-associated candidate genes among southern California white oak species ( Quercus sect. Quercus ),"Hybridization and introgression are common phenomena among oak species. These processes can be beneficial by introducing favorable genetic variants across species (adaptive introgression). Given that drought is an important stress, impacting physiological and morphological variation and limiting distributions, our goal was to identify drought-related genes that might exhibit patterns of introgression influenced by natural selection. Using RNAseq, we sequenced whole transcriptomes of 24 individuals from three oaks in southern California: (Quercus engelmannii, Quercus berberidifolia, Quercus cornelius-mulleri) and identified genetic variants to estimate admixture rates of all variants and those in drought genes. We found 398,042 variants across all loci and 4352 variants in 139 drought candidate genes. STRUCTURE analysis of all variants revealed the majority of our samples were assignable to a single species, but with several highly admixed individuals. When using drought-associated variants, the same individuals exhibited less admixture and their allele frequencies were more polarized between Engelmann and scrub oaks than when using the total gene set. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selection may act differently on functional genes, such as drought-associated genes, and point to candidate genes that are suggestive of divergent selection among species maintaining adaptive differences. For example, the drought genes that showed the strongest bias against engelmannii-fixed oak variants in scrub oaks were related to sugar transporter, coumarate-coA ligases, glutathione S-conjugation, and stress response. This pilot study illustrates that whole transcriptomes of individuals will provide useful data for identifying functional genes that contribute to adaptive divergence among hybridizing species.","Siğnem Öney-Birol,Signem Oney-Birol,Sorel Fitz‐Gibbon,Sorel Fitz-Gibbon,Jin‐Ming Chen,Jin-Ming Chen,Jin-Ming Chen,Paul F.

10.1186/s12862-019-1523-z,,,Ancient events and climate adaptive capacity shaped distinct chloroplast genetic structure in the oak lineages.,"Understanding the origin of genetic variation is thekey to predict how species will respond to future climate change. The genus Quercus is a species-rich and ecologically diverse woody genus that dominates a wide range of forests and woodland communities of the Northern Hemisphere. Quercus thus offers a unique opportunity to investigate how adaptation to environmental changes has shaped the spatial genetic structure of closely related lineages. Furthermore, Quercus provides a deep insight into how tree species will respond to future climate change. This study investigated whether closely related Quercus lineages have similar spatial genetic structures and moreover, what roles have their geographic distribution, ecological tolerance, and historical environmental changes played in the similar or distinct genetic structures. Despite their close relationships, the three main oak lineages (Quercus sections Cyclobalanopsis, Ilex, and Quercus) have different spatial genetic patterns and occupy different climatic niches. The lowest level and most homogeneous pattern of genetic diversity was found in section Cyclobalanopsis, which is restricted to warm and humid climates. The highest genetic diversity and strongest geographic genetic structure were found in section Ilex, which is due to their long-term isolation and strong local adaptation. The widespread section Quercus is distributed across the most heterogeneous range of environments; however, it exhibited moderate haplotype diversity. This is likely due to regional extinction during Quaternary climatic fluctuation in Europe and North America. Genetic variations of sections Ilex and Quercus were significantly predicted by geographic and climate variations, while those of section Cyclobalanopsis were poorly predictable by geographic or climatic diversity. Apart from the different historical environmental changes experienced by different sections, variation of their ecological or climatic tolerances and physiological traits induced varying responses to similar environment changes, resulting in distinct spatial genetic patterns.","Mengxiao Yan,Mengxiao Yan,Ruibin Liu,Ruibin Liu,Ying Liu,Ying Li,Andrew L.

This challenge can be compounded by collection biases, which may downweight specimens morphologically intermediate between traditional species. Additionally, mismatch between named species and observable phenotypes can compromise species conservation. We studied the species boundaries of Quercus acerifolia , a tree endemic to Arkansas, U.S. We performed morphometric analyses of leaves and acorns from 527 field and 138 herbarium samples of Q. acerifolia and its close relatives, Q. shumardii and Q. rubra . We employed two novel approaches: sampling ex situ collections to detect phenotypic plasticity caused by environmental variation and comparing random field samples with historical herbarium samples to identify collection biases that might undermine species delimitation. To provide genetic evidence, we also performed molecular analyses on genome‐wide SNPs. Quercus acerifolia shows distinctive morphological, ecological, and genomic characteristics, rejecting the hypothesis that Q. acerifolia is a phenotypic variant of Q. shumardii . We found mismatches between traditional taxonomy and phenotypic clusters. We detected underrepresentation of morphological intermediates in herbarium collections, which may bias species discovery and recognition. Rare species conservation requires considering and addressing taxonomic problems related to phenotypic plasticity, mismatch between taxonomy and morphological clusters, and collection biases.","Yingtong Wu,Andrew L.

In this study, we investigate global patterns of oak diversity and test the hypothesis that there are regions of the oak genome that are broadly informative about phylogeny. We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing nearly 250 Quercus species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world's oaks. We use a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method to reconstruct shifts in lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling biases. We then map the >20000 RAD-seq loci back to an annotated oak genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and phylogenetic support across the phylogeny. Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification, probably in response to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity. The strong support for the phylogeny contrasts with high genomic heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal and introgression. Oaks are phylogenomic mosaics, and their diversity may in fact depend on the gene flow that shapes the oak genome.","Andrew L. Hipp,Andrew L. Hipp,Paul S. Manos,Paul S.

10.1111/nph.14951,29274282,,Genomic data reveal cryptic lineage diversification and introgression in Californian golden cup oaks (section Protobalanus).,"Summary
Here we study hybridization, introgression and lineage diversification in the widely distributed canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and the relict island oak (Q.tomentella), two Californian golden cup oaks with an intriguing biogeographical history.
We employed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing and integrated phylogenomic and population genomic analyses to study hybridization and reconstruct the evolutionary past of these taxa.
Our analyses revealed the presence of two cryptic lineages within Q.chrysolepis. One of these lineages shares its most recent common ancestor with Q.tomentella, supporting the paraphyly of Q.chrysolepis. The split of these lineages was estimated to take place during the late Pliocene or the early Pleistocene, a time corresponding well with the common presence of Q.tomentella in the fossil records of continental California. Analyses also revealed historical hybridization among lineages, high introgression from Q.tomentella into Q.chrysolepis in their current area of sympatry, and widespread admixture between the two lineages of Q.chrysolepis in contact zones.
Our results support that the two lineages of Q.chrysolepis behave as a single functional species phenotypically and ecologically well differentiated from Q.tomentella, a situation that can be only accommodated considering hybridization and speciation as a continuum with diffuse limits.","Joaquín Ortego,Joaquín Ortego,Paul F.

Oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae) are the dominant tree genus of North America in species number and biomass, and Mexico is a global center of oak diversity. Understanding the origins of oak diversity is key to understanding biodiversity of northern temperate forests.
A phylogenetic study of biogeography, niche evolution and diversification patterns in Quercus was performed using 300 samples, 146 species. Next-generation sequencing data were generated using the restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-seq) method. A time-calibrated maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred and analyzed with bioclimatic, soils, and leaf habit data to reconstruct the biogeographic and evolutionary history of the American oaks.
Our highly resolved phylogeny demonstrates sympatric parallel diversification in climatic niche, leaf habit, and diversification rates. The two major American oak clades arose in what is now the boreal zone and radiated, in parallel, from eastern North America into Mexico and Central America.
Oaks adapted rapidly to niche transitions. The Mexican oaks are particularly numerous, not because Mexico is a center of origin, but because of high rates of lineage diversification associated with high rates of evolution along moisture gradients and between the evergreen and deciduous leaf habits. Sympatric parallel diversification in the oaks has shaped the diversity of North American forests.","Andrew L. Hipp,Andrew L. Hipp,Paul S. Manos,Paul S.

10.1111/mec.15731,33179370,,Landscape genomics of Quercus lobata reveals genes involved in local climate adaptation at multiple spatial scales,"Understanding how the environment shapes genetic variation provides critical insight about the evolution of local adaptation in natural populations. At multiple spatial scales and multiple geographic contexts within a single species, such information could address a number of fundamental questions about the scale of local adaptation and whether or not the same loci are involved at different spatial scales or geographic contexts. We used landscape genomic approaches from three local elevational transects and range-wide sampling to 1) identify genetic variation underlying local adaptation to environmental gradients in the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata, 2) examine whether putatively adaptive SNPs show signatures of selection at multiple spatial scales, and 3) map putatively adaptive variation to assess the scale and pattern of local adaptation. Of over 10k single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated with genotyping-by-sequencing, we found signatures of natural selection by climate or local environment at over 600 SNPs (536 loci), some at multiple spatial scales across multiple analyses. Candidate SNPs identified with gene-environment tests (LFMM) at the range-wide scale also showed elevated associations with climate variables compared to the background at both range-wide and elevational transect scales with gradient forest analysis. Some loci overlap with those detected in other oak species, raising the question of whether the same loci might be involved in local climate adaptation in different congeneric species that inhabit different geographic contexts. Mapping landscape patterns of adaptive versus background genetic variation identified regions of marked local adaptation and suggests nonlinear association of candidate SNPs and environmental variables. Taken together, our results offer robust evidence for novel candidate genes for local climate adaptation at multiple spatial scales.","Paul F. Gugger,Paul F.

Long-term logging and habitat destruction have resulted in population decline and distribution retreat of Q. tiaoloshanica. To determine the impact of logging on the genetic diversity of Q. tiaoloshanica, the authors investigated the genetic structures using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in four regenerated stands after logging and in one unlogged stand. Compared with the unlogged stand, the effective number of alleles per locus dropped by 1.0% in selective logging stands and by 2.0% in clear logging stands, corresponding to reductions of 3.8% and 5.2%, respectively, in mean Nei's gene diversity and 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in mean Shannon diversity index. No substantial genetic erosion was detected in any of the regenerated stands owing to the high tree density and high heterogeneity of the Q. tiaoloshanica stands investigated. Meanwhile, there was no natural regeneration of the species observed in a Dacrydium pierrei Hickel plantation 700 m away from the regenerated stands, suggesting the limited ability of seed dispersal of Q. tiaoloshanica. Clear logging should be undertaken cautiously because the total number of plant species dropped by 15.2% in the clear-logged stands compared with the unlogged stand. To conserve the genetic diversity of this species, as well as the plant biodiversity of tropical forests, the habitats of Q. tiaoloshanica should be protected against exploitation in terms of agricultural or other forms of land use, and some mature trees should be preserved as seed sources to maintain an adequate regeneration base for this species in the management of logging.

•
The ability of tree stems to recover from damage is critical for tree survival and may explain species distributions across disturbance regimes. Two primary responses to stem damage, decay compartmentalization and wound closure, act in concert to limit decay and pathogen spread. A previous study demonstrated a tradeoff between wound responses that varied with anatomical traits, but its wide taxonomic range made it hard to analyze responses in an evolutionary context.

•
Here, we tested the stem wound responses of 13 species of Quercus inhabiting three habitats across a gradient of fire intensity. We also quantified anatomical and structural traits and phylogenetic position, in order to assess the relative contributions of ecological adaptation and phylogenetic history in determining traits.

•
Xylem anatomical traits were phylogenetically constrained, while phloem traits and damage responses varied with habitat. Across habitats, hammock and sandhill species closed bark wounds effectively, whereas scrub species limited the spread of xylem decay. There was a tradeoff between wound closure and decay compartmentalization within the white+live oaks.

•
The fact that some wound response traits are phylogenetically constrained while others respond to ecological pressures suggests that damage responses integrate mechanisms operating at several levels within plants.","Claudia Romero,Claudia Romero,Benjamin M.

A critical question is how together these two processes influence the evolutionary dynamics of local populations. To assess the respective contributions of pollen and seed flow, we propose a novel indirect assessment of the separate male and female gametic contributions to total effective parental size (Ne), based on parental correlations estimated via kinship coefficients, that can be applied to data sets that include unambiguous genotypes for male and female gametic contributions. Using the endemic Californian valley oak (Quercus lobata) as our study species, we apply this method to a set of microsatellite genotypes for two distinct ecological sets of naturally recruiting seedlings with acorns attached. We found that the effective numbers of contributing male parents (Nep) exceed effective numbers of female parents (Nem) for seedlings established beneath adult trees (Nep=8.1 and Nem=1.1), as well as for seedlings established away from adult trees (Nep=15.4 and Nem=2.7), illustrating that seed dispersal enhances pollen dispersal and increases the effective number of seed sources in open seedling patches. The resulting effective parental size of seedling populations translates into smaller effective numbers of parents for undispersed vs. dispersed seedlings (Ne=3.6 and Ne=6.7, respectively). This study introduces a novel statistic method and provides important new evidence that, on a short-term temporal scale, seed dispersal shapes the local neighbourhood size of new recruits.","Delphine Grivet,Delphine Grivet,Juan J.

In this perspective, comparative phylogeographical analyses are useful in detecting common historical patterns by either comparing different species within the same area within a continent or by comparing similar species in different areas. Here, we analyse one taxon (the white oak, genus Quercus , subgenus Quercus , section Quercus ) that is widespread worldwide, and we evaluate its phylogeographical pattern on two different continents: western North America and Western Europe. The goals of the present study are: (i) to compare the chloroplast genetic diversity found in one California oak species vs. that found in the extensively studied European oak species (in France and the Iberian Peninsula); (ii) to contrast the geographical structure of haplotypes between these two taxa and test for a phylogeographical structure for the California species. For this purpose, we used the same six maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and a similar sampling strategy. The haplotype diversity within site as well as the differentiation among sites was alike in both taxa, but the Californian species has higher allelic richness with a greater number of haplotypes (39 vs. 11 in the European white oak complex). Furthermore, in California these 39 haplotypes are distributed locally in patches while in the European oaks haplotypes are distributed into lineages partitioned longitudinally. These contrasted patterns could indicate that gene movement in California oak populations have been more stable in response to past climatic and geological events, in contrast to their European counterparts.","Delphine Grivet,Delphine Grivet,Marie‐France Deguilloux,Marie-France Deguilloux,Rémy J.

Guidance is particularly needed on how many living plants are necessary to conserve a threshold level of genetic diversity in ex situ collections. We investigated this question for 11 taxa across five genera. In this first study analysing and optimizing ex situ genetic diversity across multiple genera, we found that the percentage of extant genetic diversity currently conserved varies among taxa from 40% to 95%. Most taxa are well below genetic conservation targets. Resampling datasets showed that ideal collection sizes vary widely even within a genus: one taxon typically required at least 50% more individuals than another (though Quercus was an exception). Still, across taxa, the minimum collection size to achieve genetic conservation goals is within one order of magnitude. Current collections are also suboptimal: they could remain the same size yet capture twice the genetic diversity with an improved sampling design. We term this deficiency the 'genetic conservation gap'. Lastly, we show that minimum collection sizes are influenced by collection priorities regarding the genetic diversity target. In summary, current collections are insufficient (not reaching targets) and suboptimal (not efficiently designed), and we show how improvements can be made.","Sean Hoban,Sean Hoban,Taylor Callicrate,Taylor Callicrate,John Roscoe Clark,John L.

In this study, we assessed response to water stress in a California oak species, Quercus lobata Nee, by measuring changes in gene expression profiles before and after a simulated drought stress treatment through water deprivation of seedlings in a greenhouse setting. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing from nine samples from three collection localities, we identified which genes are involved in response to drought stress and tested the hypothesis that seedlings sampled from climatically different regions of the species range respond to water stress differently. We observed a surprisingly massive transcriptional response to drought: 35,347 of 68,434 contigs (52%) were differentially expressed before versus after drought treatment, of which 18,111 were down-regulated and 17,236 were up-regulated. Genes functionally associated with abiotic stresses and death were enriched among the up-regulated genes, whereas metabolic and cell part-related genes were enriched among the down-regulated. We found 56 contigs that exhibited significantly different expression responses to the drought treatment among the three populations (treatment × population interaction), suggesting that those genes may be involved in local adaptation to drought stress. These genes have stress response (e.g., WRKY DNA-binding protein 51 and HSP20-like chaperones superfamily protein), metabolic (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase and protein kinase superfamily protein), transport/transfer (e.g., cationic amino acid transporter 7 and K⁺ transporter) and regulatory functions (e.g., WRKY51 and Homeodomain-like transcriptional regulator). Baseline expression levels of 1310 unique contigs also differed among pairs of populations, and they were enriched for metabolic and cell part-related genes.

10.1093/jhered/esy011,29509902,,Contrasting Patterns of Population History and Seed-mediated Gene Flow in Two Endemic Costa Rican Oak Species,"Lower Central America is an important area to study recent population history and diversification of Neotropical species due to its complex and dynamic geology and climate. Phylogeographic studies in this region are few in comparison with other regions and even less for tree species. The aim of the present study was to characterize the phylogeographic structure in 2 partially co-distributed endemic oak species (Quercus costaricensis and Q. bumelioides) of the Costa Rican mountains using chloroplast short sequence repeats (cpSSRs), and to test for the effect of geological and palaeoclimatic processes on their population history. Genetic diversity and structure, haplotype networks, patterns of seed-mediated gene flow and historical demography were estimated for both species. Results suggested contrasting patterns. Quercus costaricensis exhibited high values of genetic diversity, a marked phylogeographic structure, a north-to-south genetic diversity gradient and evidence of a demographic expansion during the Quaternary. Quercus bumelioides did not show significant genetic structure and the haplotype network and historical demography estimates suggested a recent population expansion probably during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The phylogeographic structure of Q. costaricensis seems to be related to Pleistocene altitudinal migration due to its higher altitudinal distribution. Meanwhile, historical seed-mediated gene flow through the lower altitudinal distribution of Q. bumelioides may have promoted the homogenization of genetic variation. Population expansion and stable availability of suitable climatic areas in both species probably indicate that palaeoclimatic changes promoted downwards altitudinal migration and formation of continuous forests allowing oak species to expand their distribution into the Panamanian mountains during glacial stages.","Hernando Rodríguez‐Correa,Hernando Rodríguez-Correa,Ken Oyama,Ken Oyama,Maurício Quesada,Mauricio Quesada,Eric J.

Here, we estimate the timing, direction and extent of gene flow between two distantly related oak species in the same section (Quercus sect. Quercus). We estimated these demographic events using genotyping by sequencing data (GBS), which generated 25,702 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 24 individuals of California scrub oak (Quercus berberidifolia) and 23 individuals of Engelmann oak (Q. engelmannii). We tested several scenarios involving gene flow between these species using the diffusion approximation-based population genetic inference framework and model-testing approach of the Python package DaDi. We found that the most likely demographic scenario includes a bottleneck in Q. engelmannii that coincides with asymmetric gene flow from Q. berberidifolia into Q. engelmannii. Given that the timing of this gene flow coincides with the advent of a Mediterranean-type climate in the California Floristic Province, we propose that changing precipitation patterns and seasonality may have favored the introgression of climate-associated genes from the endemic into the non-endemic California oak.","Scott T O'Donnell,Scott T O'Donnell,Sorel Fitz‐Gibbon,Sorel Fitz-Gibbon,Victoria L.

Despite being a small clade, they display a range of leaf morphologies comparable to the largest sections (>100 spp.) in Quercus. Their fossil record extends back to the Eocene. Here, we explore how cork oaks achieved their modern ranges and how legacy effects might explain niche evolution in modern species of section Cerris and its sister section Ilex, the holly oaks.We inferred a dated phylogeny for cork and holly oaks using a reduced-representation next-generation sequencing method, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and used D-statistics to investigate gene flow hypotheses. We estimated divergence times using a fossilized birth-death model calibrated with 47 fossils. We used Köppen profiles, selected bioclimatic parameters and forest biomes occupied by modern species to infer ancestral climatic and biotic niches.East Asian and Western Eurasian cork oaks diverged initially in the Eocene. Subsequently, four Western Eurasian lineages (subsections) differentiated during the Oligocene and Miocene. Evolution of leaf size, form and texture was correlated, in part, with multiple transitions from ancestral humid temperate climates to mediterranean, arid and continental climates. Distantly related but ecologically similar species converged on similar leaf traits in the process.Originating in temperate (frost-free) biomes, Eocene to Oligocene ranges of the primarily deciduous cork oaks were restricted to higher latitudes (Siberia to north of Paratethys). Members of the evergreen holly oaks (section Ilex) also originated in temperate biomes but migrated southwards and south-westwards into then-(sub)tropical southern China and south-eastern Tibet during the Eocene, then westwards along existing pre-Himalayan mountain ranges. Divergent biogeographical histories and deep-time phylogenetic legacies (in cold and drought tolerance, nutrient storage and fire resistance) thus account for the modern species mosaic of Western Eurasian oak communities, which are composed of oaks belonging to four sections.","Thomas Denk,Guido W.

A key issue is whether remnant individuals become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak ( Quercus lobata ) is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen donors ( N ep ) and average distance of effective pollen movement ( δ ). Using TWOGENER , our recently developed hybrid model of paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current N ep = 3.68 individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen dispersal distance ( δ δ δ ) and estimated δ = 64.8 m. We then deployed our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick population to evaluate the extent to which N ep may have changed, as a consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999. Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate N ep was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic isolation.","Victoria L.

10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118819,,,Using multiple seedlots in restoration planting enhances genetic diversity compared to natural regeneration in fragmented tropical forests,"Abstract   Catastrophic degradation of forests is ongoing worldwide and leads to severe forest fragmentation. Restoration plantings are often necessary to restore fragmented forests, complementing the limited natural regeneration. High genetic diversity is critical for the long-term viability of restored forests. However, there is limited knowledge of whether planted populations capture a genetic variation comparable to natural populations. We measured the efficiency of two forest restoration strategies using the common tropical oak Quercus bambusifolia. The multi-seedlot planting was established over ten years by collecting seeds from several locations in fragmented secondary forests of Hong Kong, while the single seedlot planting was established in just one year with seeds from a single natural location. We analysed the genetic diversity and genetic structure from both plantings and compared them with natural populations. The multi-seedlot planting exhibited a higher rate of genetic recovery, greater genetic diversity (He=0.69), and higher effective population size (Ne_p=86.5) compared to natural populations (He=0.66, Ne_p=64.3, on average) and the single seedlot planting (He=0.50, Ne_p=30.8). The multi-seedlot planting erased the effect of seed shadows which was detected in natural populations while the single seedlot planting strengthened the effect. We conclude that capturing high levels of genetic diversity in the collection of propagules is a standard requirement to ensure the long-term viability of forest restoration. Propagule collection over multiple years is required when only a few parental trees are available to avoid founder effects.","Xueqin Zeng,Xueqin Zeng,Gunter A. Fischer,Gunter A. Fischer,Gunter A.

10.1007/s11295-016-1048-1,,,Conservation genetics of rare trees restricted to subtropical montane cloud forests in southern China: a case study from Quercus arbutifolia (Fagaceae),"Montane cloud forests (MCFs), with their isolated nature, offer excellent opportunities to study the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation and the impacts of climate change. Quercus arbutifolia is a rare oak in MCFs of southern China and Vietnam. Its isolated populations, small population size and unique ecological niche make this species vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss. In this study, we used chloroplast (cpDNA) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences to investigate genetic divergence patterns and demographic history of five of the six known populations of Q. arbutifolia. Considering its small population size and fragmentation, Q. arbutifolia has unexpectedly high genetic diversity. The time since the most recent common ancestor of all cpDNA haplotypes was c. 10.25 Ma, and the rapid diversification of haplotypes occurred during the Quaternary. The maximum clade credibility chronogram of cpDNA haplotypes suggests that the DM population (Daming Mountain, Guangxi province) diverged early and rapidly became isolated from other populations. The Pearl River drainage system may have been the main geographic barrier between DM and other populations since the late Miocene. ITS data suggests that population expansion occurred during the last interglacial of the Quaternary. The combined effects of pre-Quaternary and Quaternary climatic and geological changes were the main drivers to the current genetic diversity and distribution pattern of Q. arbutifolia. Because of the high between-population genetic differentiation and high within-population genetic diversity of Q. arbutifolia, conservation efforts should be implemented for all populations, but if conservation resources are limited, populations DM, YZ (Mang Mountain, Hunan province) and ZZ (Daqin Mountain, Fujian province) should have priority.","Jin Xu,Jin Xu,Xiao‐Long Jiang,Min Deng,Xiao-Long Jiang,Min Deng,Murphy Westwood,Yi‐Gang Song,Murphy Westwood,Gregor Kozlowski,Yi-Gang Song,Yi-Gang Song,Yi-Gang Song,Sisi Zheng,Si-Si Zheng",Tree Genetics & Genomes,2016
10.1007/s11258-017-0705-2,,,Effects of landscape features on gene flow of valley oaks (Quercus lobata).,"Landscape features affect habitat connectivity and patterns of gene flow and hence influence genetic structure among populations. We studied valley oak (Quercus lobata), a threatened species of California (USA) savannas and oak woodlands, with a distribution forming a ring around the Central Valley grasslands. Our main goal was to determine the role of topography and land cover on patterns of gene flow and to test whether elevation or land cover forms stronger barriers to gene flow among valley oak populations. We sampled valley oaks in 12 populations across the range of this species, genotyped each tree at eight nuclear microsatellite loci, and created a series of resistance surfaces by assigning different resistance values to land cover type and elevation. We also estimated recent migration rates and evaluated them with regard to landscape features. There was a significant but weak relationship between Euclidian distance and genetic distance. There was no relationship between genetic distances and land cover, but a significant relationship between genetic distances and elevation resistance. We conclude that gene flow is restricted by high elevations in the northern part of the valley oak range and by high elevations and the Central Valley further south. Migration rate analysis indicated some gene flow occurring east–west but we suggest that the high connectivity in the northern Central Valley is facilitating the formation of these links. We predict that southern populations may become more differentiated in the future through genetic isolation and local adaptation taking place in the face of climate change.","Maryam Gharehaghaji,Maryam Gharehaghaji,Emily S.

10.1007/s10342-014-0839-x,,,Leaf morphological evidence of natural hybridization between two oak species (Quercus austrocochinchinensis and Q. kerrii) and its implications for conservation management,"Natural hybridization is known to be a potential threat to rare and endangered species due to the risk of extensive genetic swamping or assimilation. However, hybridization may also beneficial for rare species by increasing their genetic variation and adaptive potential. Quercus austrocochinchinensis is an endangered oak species that overlaps geographically with the common, widespread Q. kerrii. Morphological intermediates are common in contact zones between the species, suggesting interspecific hybridization. This phenomenon may lead to pure Q. austrocochinchinensis facing a larger threat. Given the importance of leaf morphology for hybrid identification in oaks, we characterized leaf morphological and anatomical features of pure populations of Q. kerrii and Q. austrocochinchinensis and a population of probable hybrids at the contact zone. The results demonstrate that (1) leaf morphological features of putative hybrids are stable and distinct from the parental taxa, and more similar to those of Q. kerrii; (2) anticlinal wall patterns of abaxial epidermal cells show the most significant differences between parental species and probable hybrids, providing an important character for species identification; and (3) putative hybrids were intermediate in leaf anatomical features between the two parental species. The leaf traits for identified Q. austrocochinchinensis, Q. kerrii and hybrids can be used to estimate the hybridization ratio at the contact zone. The morphological evidence, sympatry and phenology strongly suggest that the rare Q. austrocochinchinensis forms hybrids with the more widespread Q. kerrii. Natural hybridization might play an important future role in both migration and adaptation of the species to novel environments. Thus, the characters we identify here for diagnosing hybrids provide an important tool for conserving species and genetic diversity. We suggest that a management plan for Q. austrocochinchinensis should address the conservation of both of the pure species, investigation of gene flow dynamics in the hybrid zone and investigation of the impacts of gene flow on fitness of the two species.","Gregor Kozlowski,Yi‐Gang Song,Yi-Gang Song,Yi-Gang Song,Yi-Gang Song,Min Deng,Min Deng,Andrew L.

10.1002/tax.592002,,,The oaks of western Eurasia: Traditional classifications and evidence from two nuclear markers,"Phylogenetic relationships among species of Quercus (oaks) from western Eurasia including the western part of the Himalayas are examined for the first time. Based on ITS and 5S-IGS data three major infrageneric groups are recognized for western Eurasia: the cerroid, iliciod, and roburoid oaks. While individuals of the cerroid and ilicoid groups cluster according to their species, particularly in the 5S-IGS analyses, individuals of species of roburoid oaks do not cluster with exception of Quercus pontica. The Cypriot endemic Quercus alnifolia belongs to the ilicoid oaks, in contrast to traditional views placing it within the cerroid oaks. Based on all ITS data available, the groups identified for western Eurasia can be integrated into a global infrageneric framework for Quercus. The Ilex group is resurrected as a well-defined group that comprises taxa traditionally placed into six subsections of Q. sects. Cerris and Lepidobalanus (white oaks) sensu Camus. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest two major lineages within Quercus, each consisting of three infrageneric groups. Within the first lineage, the Quercus group (roburoid oaks in western Eurasia) and the Lobatae group evolved by ""budding"" as is reflected by incomplete lineage sorting, high variability within groups, and low differentiation among groups. The groups of the second lineage, including the Cyclobalanopsis, Cerris (cerroid oaks in western Eurasia), and Ilex (ilicoid oaks in western Eurasia) groups, evolved in a more tree-like fashion.","Thomas Denk,Thomas Denk,Guido W.

10.1002/ajb2.1315,31216071,,Influence of a climatic gradient on genetic exchange between two oak species.,"PREMISE: In plant groups with limited intrinsic barriers to gene flow, it is thought that environmental conditions can modulate interspecific genetic exchange. Oaks are known for limited barriers to gene flow among closely related species. Here, we use Quercus as a living laboratory in which to pursue a fundamental question in plant evolution: Do environmental gradients restrict or promote genetic exchange between species? METHODS: We focused on two North American oaks, the rare Quercus dumosa and the widespread Q. berberidifolia. We sampled intensively along a contact zone in California, USA. We sequenced restriction site-associated DNA markers and measured vegetative phenotype. We tested for genetic exchange, the association with climate, and the effect on phenotype. RESULTS: There is evidence for genetic exchange between the species. Admixed plants are found in areas of intermediate climate, while less admixed plants are found at the extremes of the climatic gradient. Genetic and phenotypic patterns are out of phase in the contact zone; some plants display the phenotype of one species but are genetically associated with another. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that a strong climatic gradient can promote genetic exchange between species. The overall weak correlation between genotype and phenotype in the contact zone between the species suggests that genetic exchange can lead to the breakdown of trait combinations used to define species. This incongruency predicts ongoing problems for conservation of Q. dumosa, with implications for conservation of other oaks.","Dylan O. Bürge,Dylan O. Burge,V. Thomas Parker,V.

Recent estimates of pollen dispersal suggest a small reproductive neighborhood. Whether small neighborhood size is a recent phenomenon, a consequence of reduced gene flow caused by demographic changes, or whether it has been historically restricted, remains unclear. To examine this question, we have characterized the spatial genetic structure of N 5 191 Q. lobata individuals, spread over an area of 230 ha, using eight microsatellite loci. The observed autocorrelogram suggests an historical standard deviation of gene flow distance of about 350 m per generation, higher than contemporary pollen dispersal estimates. To determine whether our estimates were affected by strong prevailing winds from the west‐northwest, we developed and utilized a novel anisotropic autocorrelation analysis. We detected no more than a hint of anisotropy, and we concluded that adult spatial structure is indicative of strong historical signature of ‘‘isolation by distance.’’ This historical estimate provides a useful reference value against which to gauge the future gene flow consequences of ongoing anthropogenic disturbance.","Cyril Dutech,Cyril Dutech,Cyril Dutech,Cyril Dutech,Victoria L.

Because most phylogeographic studies have used neutral markers, the role of selection may have been undervalued. In this paper, we contend that plants provide a useful evolutionary lesson about the impact of selection on spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation, when the environment affects which individuals can colonize new sites, and on adaptive genetic variation, when environmental heterogeneity creates divergence at specific loci underlying local adaptation. Specifically, we discuss five characteristics found in plants that intensify the impact of selection: sessile growth form, high reproductive output, leptokurtic dispersal, isolation by environment, and the potential to evolve longevity. Collectively, these traits exacerbate the impact of environment on movement between populations and local selection pressures—both of which influence phylogeographic structure. We illustrate how these unique traits shape these processes with case studies of the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata, and the western North American lichen, Ramalina menziesii. Obviously, the lessons we learn from plant traits are not unique to plants, but they highlight the need for future animal, plant, and microbe studies to incorporate its impact. Modern tools that generate genome-wide sequence data are now allowing us to decipher how evolutionary processes affect the spatial distribution of different kinds of genes and also to better model future spatial distribution of species in response to climate change.","Victoria L.

We sequenced whole genomes of 101 individuals of three closely related oak species to track the divergence history and dissect the impacts of selective sweeps and background selection on patterns of genomic variation. We estimated that the three species diverged around the late Neogene and experienced a bottleneck during the Pleistocene. We detected genomic regions with elevated relative differentiation (""FST -islands""). Population genetic inferences from the site frequency spectrum and ancestral recombination graph indicated that FST -islands were formed by selective sweeps. We also found extensive positive selection; the fixation of adaptive mutations and reduction neutral diversity around substitutions generated a signature of selective sweeps. Prevalent negative selection and background selection have reduced genetic diversity in both genic and intergenic regions and contributed substantially to the baseline variation in genetic diversity. Our results demonstrate the importance of linked selection in shaping genomic variation, and illustrate how the extent and strength of different selection models vary across the genome.","Yi‐Ye Liang,Yi-Ye Liang,Yong Shi,Yong Shi,Shuai Yuan,Shuai Yuan,Biaofeng Zhou,Biao-Feng Zhou,Xueyan Chen,Xue-Yan Chen,Qing-Qing An,Qing-Qing An,Pär K.

These species extend over diverse environmental conditions and are thus interesting models for studies of plant adaptation and speciation. The genomic toolbox is an important asset for exploring the functional variation associated with natural selection. The assembly of previously available and newly developed long and short sequence reads for two sympatric oak species, Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, generated a comprehensive catalog of transcripts for oak. The functional annotation of 91k contigs demonstrated the presence of a large proportion of plant genes in this unigene set. Comparisons with SwissProt accessions and five plant gene models revealed orthologous relationships, making it possible to decipher the evolution of the oak genome. In particular, it was possible to align 9.5 thousand oak coding sequences with the equivalent sequences on peach chromosomes. Finally, RNA-seq data shed new light on the gene networks underlying vegetative bud dormancy release, a key stage in development allowing plants to adapt their phenology to the environment. In addition to providing a vast array of expressed genes, this study generated essential information about oak genome evolution and the regulation of genes associated with vegetative bud phenology, an important adaptive traits in trees. This resource contributes to the annotation of the oak genome sequence and will provide support for forward genetics approaches aiming to link genotypes with adaptive phenotypes.","Isabelle Lesur,Isabelle Lesur,Grégoire Le Provost,Grégoire Le Provost,Pascal Bento,Pascal Bento,Corinne Da Silva,Corinne Da Silva,Jean‐Charles Leplé,Jean-Charles Leplé,Florent Murat,Florent Murat,S.

Oaks are taxonomically perplexing due to interspecific shared morphological traits and intraspecific morphological variation, which mainly attributed to hybridization. Universal plastid markers could not provide sufficient variable sites to explore the phylogeny of this genus and chloroplast genome-scale data proved to be useful to resolve intractable phylogenetic relationships. In this study, four complete chloroplast genomes of Quercus species were sequenced and one published chloroplast genomes of Q. baronii was retrieved for comparative analyses. The sizes of these five chloroplast genomes ranged from 161,072 bp (Q. baronii) to 161,237 bp (Q. dolicholepis), which has been identified the gene organization, gene order and GC content are similar to other published Fagaceae species. We analyzed the nucleotide substitution, indels and repeats in chloroplast genomes. The detection of 19 relatively highly variable regions provides potential plastid markers for further taxonomic and phylogenetic study within Quercus. We future observed that 4 genes (ndhA, ndhK, petA and ycf1) were subjected to positive selection. Finally, the phylogenetic relationships of the published Quercus species inferred from chloroplast genomes obtained moderate-to-high supports, indicating that chloroplast genome data may be useful to resolve the relationships of this genus.","Yanci Yang,Yanci Yang,Tao Zhou,Tao Zhou,Tao Zhou,Dong Duan,Dong Duan,Jia Yang,Jia Yang,Li Feng,Li Feng,Guifang Zhao,Gui-Fang Zhao",Frontiers in Plant Science,2016
10.1111/gcb.14497,30358018,,New insights into adaptation and population structure of cork oak using genotyping by sequencing,"Species respond to global climatic changes in a local context. Understanding this process, including its speed and intensity, is paramount due to the pace at which such changes are currently occurring. Tree species are particularly interesting to study in this regard due to their long generation times, sedentarism, and ecological and economic importance. Quercus suber L. is an evergreen forest tree species of the Fagaceae family with an essentially Western Mediterranean distribution. Despite frequent assessments of the species' evolutionary history, large-scale genetic studies have mostly relied on plastidial markers, whereas nuclear markers have been used on studies with locally focused sampling strategies. In this work, ""Genotyping by sequencing"" is used to derive 1,996 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to assess the species' evolutionary history from a nuclear DNA perspective, gain insights into how local adaptation is shaping the species' genetic background, and to forecast how Q.suber may respond to global climatic changes from a genetic perspective. Results reveal (a) an essentially unstructured species, where (b) a balance between gene flow and local adaptation keeps the species' gene pool somewhat homogeneous across its distribution, but still allowing (c) variation clines for the individuals to cope with local conditions. ""Risk of Non-Adaptedness"" (RONA) analyses suggest that for the considered variables and most sampled locations, (d) the cork oak should not require large shifts in allele frequencies to survive the predicted climatic changes. Future directions include integrating these results with ecological niche modeling perspectives, improving the RONA methodology, and expanding its use to other species. With the implementation presented in this work, the RONA can now also be easily assessed for other organisms.","Francisco Pina‐Martins,Francisco Pina-Martins,João Baptista,João L.

Recent advances in population genetics and landscape genomic analyses enable identification of putative adaptive loci and specific selective pressures acting on local adaptation. Here, we sampled 60 evergreen oak (Quercus aquifolioides) populations throughout the species' range and pool-sequenced 587 individuals at drought-stress candidate genes. We analyzed patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation for 381 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 65 candidate genes and eight microsatellites. Outlier loci were identified by genetic differentiation analysis and genome-environment associations. The response pattern of genetic variation to environmental gradient was assessed by linear isolation-by-distance/environment tests, redundancy analysis, and nonlinear methods. SNPs and microsatellites revealed two genetic lineages: Tibet and Hengduan Mountains-Western Sichuan Plateau (HDM-WSP), with reduced genetic diversity in Tibet lineage. More outlier loci were detected in HDM-WSP lineage than Tibet lineage. Among these, three SNPs in two genes responded to dry season precipitation in the HDM-WSP lineage but not in Tibet. By contrast, genetic variation in the Tibet lineage was related to geographic distance instead of the environment. Furthermore, risk of nonadaptedness (RONA) analyses suggested HDM-WSP lineage will have a better capacity to adapt in the predicted future climate compared with the Tibet lineage. We detected genetic imprints consistent with natural selection and molecular adaptation to drought on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) over a range of long-lived and widely distributed oak species in a changing environment. Our results suggest that different within-species adaptation processes occur in species occurring in heterogeneous environments.","Fang Du,Fang K.

Evergreen oaks are keystone canopy trees in EBLFs with important ecosystem function and crucial significance for regional biodiversity conservation. However, the species composition and diversity of Asian evergreen oaks are poorly understood. Here, we test whether the four chloroplast markers atpI-atpH, matK, psbA-trnH and ycf1, can discriminate the two evergreen oak sections in Asia - Cyclobalanopsis and Ilex. 272 individuals representing 57 species were scanned and 17 species from other oaks sections were included for phylogenetic reconstruction. The genetic diversity of the Quercus sections was also compared. Overall, we found that universal chloroplast DNA barcoding markers could resolve two clades in Quercus, i.e., subgenus Cerris (Old World Clade) and subgenus Quercus (New World Clade). The chloroplast markers distinguished the main sections, with few exceptions. Each cpDNA region showed no barcoding gap and none of them provided good resolution at the species level. The best species resolution (27.78%) was obtained when three or four markers were combined and analyzed using BLAST. The high conservation of the chloroplast DNA and complicated evolutionary patterns, due to incomplete lineage sorting, interspecific hybridization and introgressions may hinder the ability of cpDNA markers to discriminate different species. When comparing diversification pattern across Quercus sections (Cyclobalanopsis, Ilex, Cerris, Quercus and Protobalanus), we found that section Ilex was the most genetically diverse, and section Cyclobalanopsis was lower genetically diverse. This diversification pattern may have resulted from the interplay of the Eurasia Cenozoic tectonic movements, climate changes and different niches of their ancestral lineages.","Mengxiao Yan,Mengxiao Yan,Yanshi Xiong,Yanshi Xiong,Ruibin Liu,Ruibin Liu,Min Deng,Min Deng,Jiao-Jiao Song,Jiaojiao Song",Frontiers in Plant Science,2018

The aims of this study were twofold. First, to provide data on the genetic diversity of pubescent oaks from an understudied area which currently exhibits one of the highest concentrations of pubescent oak species in Europe. Second, to verify if these groups of oaks are genetically distinct and if their identification is in accordance with the current taxonomic classification. Molecular analyses of leaf material of 480 trees from seventeen populations belonging to putatively different pubescent oak species (Quercus amplifolia, Q. congesta, Q. dalechampii, Q. ichnusae, Q. leptobalanos, Q. virgiliana) were performed. Twelve gene-based Expressed Sequence Tag-Simple Sequence Repeat markers were selected, and genetic diversity and differentiation were calculated. The results showed relatively high values of allelic richness, heterozygosity and number of private alleles for the populations investigated. A weak but positive correlation between geographical and genetic distance was detected. Genetic assignment (STRUCTURE) and principle coordinate analyses exhibited a weak separation into two genetic groups which, however, did not correspond to the taxonomic, chorological and ecological features of the populations investigated. Sardinian populations formed one group which was separated from the Calabrian and Sicilian populations.

We used next-generation sequencing to identify chloroplast 27 genome regions that differentiate the origin of white oaks from the three continents; Asia, 28 Europe, and North America. By using the chloroplast genome of Asian Q. mongolica as a 29 reference, we identified 861 variant sites (672 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); 189 30 insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism) from representative species of three continents (Q. 31 mongolica from Asia; Q. petraea and Q. robur from Europe; Q. alba from North America), 32 and we identified additional chloroplast polymorphisms in pools of 20 individuals each from 33 Q. mongolica (789 variant sites) and Q. robur (346 variant sites). Genome sequences were 34 screened for insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms to develop markers that identify 35 continental origin of oak species, and that can be easily evaluated using a variety of 36 detection methods. We identified five indel and one SNP that reliably identify continent-of37 origin, based on evaluations of up to 1078 individuals representing 13 white oak species and 38 three continents.

In this study, we combine information from nuclear microsatellite markers and niche modelling to analyse the factors structuring genetic variation across the southernmost populations of the tropical oak Quercus segoviensis. First, we tested the hypothesis that genetic variability decreases with population isolation and increases with local habitat suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Second, we employed a recently developed multiple matrix regression with randomisation (MMRR) approach to study the factors associated with genetic divergence among the studied populations and test the relative contribution of environmental and geographic isolation to contemporary patterns of genetic differentiation. We found that genetic diversity was negatively correlated with average genetic differentiation with other populations, indicating that isolation and limited gene flow have contributed to erode genetic variability in some populations. Considering the relatively small size of the study area (<120 km), analyses of genetic structure indicate a remarkable inter-population genetic differentiation. Environmental dissimilarity and differences in current and past climate niche suitability and their additive effects were not associated with genetic differentiation after controlling for geographic distance, indicating that local climate does not contribute to explain spatial patterns of genetic structure. Overall, our data indicate that geographic isolation, but not current or past climate, is the main factor determining contemporary patterns of genetic diversity and structure within the southernmost peripheral populations of this tropical oak.","Joaquín Ortego,Joaquín Ortego,Raúl Bonal,Raúl Bonal,Raúl Bonal,Alberto Muñoz,Alberto Muñoz,Alberto Muñoz,Josep María Espelta,Josep Maria Espelta",Plant Biology,2015

Nowadays, human land use has led to a large forest conversion, creating many fragmented areas where remnant trees play an important role in conserving biodiversity. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a recent anthropogenic forest fragmentation on the genetic diversity and genetic heterogeneity of pollen pools accepted by individuals of the red oak Quercus castanea growing in forest patches and as isolated trees in central Mexico. Pollen movement was also evaluated by the analysis of outcrossing rates using seven nuclear microsatellites. We assumed that adult trees are remnants of the populations that existed previous to the forest fragmentation, while progenies of these trees are the result of recent reproductive events occurring after the fragmentation. We found high genetic diversity in both adult trees and progenies, even though progenies of isolated trees showed a significant reduction in heterozygosity as compared to their mother trees. However, the results of TWOGENER and mating system analyses indicated similar numbers of pollen donors in the progenies of mother trees from fragments and in isolated trees. Overall, our results suggest that gene flow is still extensive among forest fragments and isolated trees, conferring them a great value for the conservation of genetic diversity and connectivity.","Ken Oyama,Ken Oyama,María Luisa Herrera-Arroyo,María Luisa Herrera-Arroyo,Víctor Rocha‐Ramírez,Víctor Rocha-Ramírez,Julieta Benítez‐Malvido,Julieta Benítez-Malvido,Eduardo Ruiz‐Sánchez,Eduardo Ruiz-Sanchez,Antonio González‐Rodríguez,Antonio González-Rodríguez",Forest Ecology and Management,2017
10.1007/s10682-004-5145-5,,,Clonal and genetic structure of two Mexican oaks: Quercus eduardii and Quercus potosina (Fagaceae),"Quercus eduardii and Q. potosina are dominant oak species in Sierra Fria, Aguascalientes, Mexico. These species have been exploited for multiple purposes since the 16th century. Both species produce clonal offspring through root suckering and acorns through sexual reproduction. To understand clonality for the implementation of the most adequate actions for the conservation of these species, we addressed the following questions: (a) what is the spatial clonal structure of both species? (b) How much clonal and genetic diversity is maintained in these species? Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) were used as molecular markers for these analyses. Genets of both species have few ramets and these grow close the parent tree. Autocorrelation analyses at the ramet level showed an aggregated distribution at short distances and a random spatial distribution at larger distances. Also, at the genet level the autocorrelation analyses showed a random distribution. Clonal diversity was high in both species (Q. eduardii: D=0.963, G/N=0.60; Q. potosina: D=0.985, G/N=0.65). Genetic diversity was high within populations (Q. eduardii: He=0.33±0.11; Q. potosina: He=0.35±0.11). Low levels of genetic differentiation among populations were observed (Q. eduardii ϕst=0.19, P < 0.002; Q. potosina ϕst=0.13, P < 0.002). Both species maintain high levels of clonal and genetic diversity, probably due to successful sexual reproduction, which allows gene flow among populations. Conservation and/or reforestation programs must include seed collections and germplasm banks. Due to the small genet size and the high clonal diversity of these species, seeds can be collected in any place in Sierra Fria, Aguascalientes.","Prosenjit Bose,Cecilia Alfonso-Corrado,Cecilia Alfonso-Corrado,Rocío Esteban-Jiménez,Rocío Esteban-Jiménez,Ricardo Clark‐Tapia,Ricardo Clark-Tapia,Daniel Piñero,Daniel Piñero,Jorge E.

Recent studies have shown contrasting patterns regarding the role of geographic elements as barriers that could have determined phylogeographic structure in various species. Recently, the phylogeography and biogeography of Quercus species have been studied intensively, and the patterns observed so far suggest contrasting evolutionary histories for Neotropical species in comparison with their Holarctic relatives. The goal of this study was to describe the phylogeographic structure of two Neotropical oak species (Quercus insignis and Quercus sapotifolia) in the context of the geological and palaeoclimatic history of the northern Neotropics. Populations through the distribution range of both species were collected and characterized using nine chloroplast DNA microsatellite loci. Both oak species showed high levels of genetic diversity and strong phylogeographic structure. The distribution of genetic variation in Q. insignis suggested an influence of two major barriers, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Nicaraguan Depression, while Q. sapotifolia exhibited a genetic structure defined by the heterogeneity of the Chortis highlands. The haplotype networks of both species indicated complex histories, suggesting that colonization from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas to central Mexico and from the north of the Nicaraguan Depression to the Costa Rican mountains may have occurred during different stages, and apparently more than one time. In conclusion, the phylogeographic structure of Neotropical oak species seems to be defined by a combination of geological and climatic events.","Hernando Rodríguez‐Correa,Hernando Rodríguez-Correa,Ken Oyama,Ken Oyama,Maurício Quesada,Mauricio Quesada,Eric J.

An oak species complex occurring in Mexico formed by two parental species, Quercus crassifolia H. & B. and Q. crassipes H. & B., and their putative hybrid species, Q. dysophylla, was analyzed with molecular markers (random amplified polymorphic DNA [RAPDs]) and morphological tools in seven hybrid zones (10 trees per taxa in each hybrid zone) and two pure sites for each parental species (20 trees per site). We tested whether geographic proximity of hybrid plants to the allopatric site of a parental species increases its morphological and genetic similarity with its parent. Seventeen morphological traits were measured in 8700 leaves from 290 trees. Total DNA of 250 individuals was analyzed with six diagnostic RAPD primers. Quercus crassifolia differed significantly from Q. crassipes in all the examined characters. Molecular markers and morphological characters were highly coincident and support the hypothesis of hybridization in this complex, although both species remain distinct in mixed stands. Clusters and a hybrid index (for molecular and morphological data) showed that individuals from the same parental species were more similar among themselves than to putative hybrids, indicating occasional hybridization with segregation in hybrid types or backcrossing to parents.

Oaks (genus Quercus, Fagaceae) are among the model species for the study of hybridization. Natural co-occurrence of four closely related oak species is a very rare case in the temperate forests of Europe. We used both morphological characters and genetic markers to characterize hybridization in a natural community situated in west-central Romania and which consists of Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescen s, and Q. frainetto, respectively. On the basis of pubescence and leaf morphological characters ~94% of the sampled individuals were assigned to pure species. Only 16 (~6%) individual trees exhibited intermediate morphologies or a combination of characters of different species. Four chloroplast DNA haplotypes were identified in the study area. The distribution of haplotypes within the white oak complex showed substantial differences among species. However, the most common haplotypes were present in all four species. Furthermore, based on a set of 7 isozyme and 6 microsatellite markers and using a Bayesian admixture analysis without any a priori information on morphology we found that four genetic clusters best fit the data. There was a very good correspondence of each species with one of the inferred genetic clusters. The estimated introgression level varied markedly between pairs of species ranging from 1.7% between Q. robur and Q. frainetto to 16.2% between Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto. Only nine individuals (3.4%) appeared to be first-generation hybrids. Our data indicate that natural hybridization has occurred at relatively low rates. The different levels of gene flow among species might be explained by differences in flowering time and spatial position within the stand. In addition, a partial congruence between phenotypically and genetically intermediate individuals was found, suggesting that intermediate appearance does not necessarily mean hybridization. However, it appears that natural hybridization did not seriously affect the species identity in this area of sympatry.","Alexandru Lucian Curtu,Alexandru Lucian Curtu,Oliver Gailing,Oliver Gailing,Reiner Finkeldey,Reiner Finkeldey",BMC Evolutionary Biology,2007

The results indicate that the species has an average moderate genetic diversity ( H  e = 0.764 ± 0.014), without signifitive differences between, sites with local use and forest management. We found a low genetic structure among population ( F  ST = 0.025 ± 0.047 y R  ST = 0.157 ± 0.135), due to a moderate gene flow ( N  e  m = 6.7), which is responsible for the absence of loci under directional selection. The excessive extraction of individuals affects the population viability and regeneration of the species, which in the future may have a negative effect on the genetic diversity and the processes of genetic differentiation among populations. This study provides essential information that will be useful for decision-making in conservation activities and management plans for Q. crassifolia in Sierra Juarez, Oaxaca.","Montserrat Gorgonio-Ramírez,Montserrat Gorgonio-Ramírez,Ricardo Clark‐Tapia,Ricardo Clark Tapia,Jorge E.

10.3390/genes13112156,36421830,,Comprehensive Analysis of Codon Usage in Quercus Chloroplast Genome and Focus on psbA Gene.,"Quercus (oak) is an important economic and ecological tree species in the world, and it is the necessary feed for oak silkworm feeding. Chloroplasts play an important role in green plants but the codon usage of oak chloroplast genomes is not fully studied. We examined the codon usage of the oak chloroplast genomes in detail to facilitate the understanding of their biology and evolution. We downloaded all the protein coding genes of 26 non-redundant chloroplast reference genomes, removed short ones and those containing internal stop codons, and finally retained 50 genes shared by all genomes for comparative analyses. The base composition, codon bias, and codon preference are not significantly different between genomes but are significantly different among genes within these genomes. Oak chloroplast genomes prefer T/A-ending codons and avoid C/G-ending codons, and the psbA gene has the same preference except for the codons encoding amino acid Phe. Complex factors such as context-dependent mutations are the major factors affecting codon usage in these genomes, while selection plays an important role on the psbA gene. Our study provided an important understanding of codon usage in the oak chloroplast genomes and found that the psbA gene has nearly the same codon usage preference as other genes in the oak chloroplasts.","Sheng-Lin Shi,Shi Sheng,Yan-Qun Liu,Yan-Qun Liu,Run-Xi Xia,Run-Xi Xia,Li Qin,Qin Li",Genes,2022
10.1111/1442-1984.12109,,,Geographic structure of genetic and phenotypic variation in the hybrid zone between Quercus affinis and Q. laurina in Mexico,"Analyzing the structure of hybrid zones is important for inferring their origin, dynamics and evolutionary significance. We examined the geographic structure of phenotypic and genetic variation in the contact zone between two Mexican red oaks, Quercus affinis and Q. laurina. A total of 105 individuals from seven populations were sampled along a 600-km latitudinal gradient representing the distribution area of the two species and their contact zone. Individuals were genotyped for nine nuclear and four chloroplast DNA microsatellite loci (ncSSR and cpSSR, respectively), and characterized for several leaf and acorn traits. The cpSSR data revealed extensive haplotype sharing among populations of the two species, while a Bayesian assignment analysis based on ncSSRs identified two main genetic groups, each corresponding to one of the species, and two populations in the contact zone showing evidence of admixture. The proportion of genetic ancestry in the populations was strongly associated with latitude and showed a pattern of variation with the shape of a narrow sigmoidal cline. The variation in three of the seven phenotypic traits was partially congruent with molecular variation, while the other traits did not conform to a geographic cline but instead were correlated with environmental variables. In conclusion, the hybrid zone between the two oak species has some of the characteristics of a tension zone, but heterogeneous variation across traits suggests differential introgression and the action of extrinsic selection.","Selene Ramos-Ortiz,S.

Therefore, increased drought will affect forests both in terms of adaptive ecology and ecosystemic services. However, how vegetation might adapt to drought is poorly understood. In this report, four years of climate change was simulated by excluding 35% of precipitation above a downy oak forest. RNASeq data allowed us to assemble a genome-guided transcriptome. This led to the identification of differentially expressed features, which was supported by the characterization of target metabolites using a metabolomics approach. We provided 2.5 Tb of RNASeq data and the assembly of the first genome guided transcriptome of Quercus pubescens. Up to 5724 differentially expressed transcripts were obtained; 42 involved in plant response to drought. Transcript set enrichment analysis showed that drought induces an increase in oxidative pressure that is mitigated by the upregulation of ubiquitin-like protein protease, ferrochelatase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase and oxo-acid-lyase activities. Furthermore, the downregulation of auxin biosynthesis and transport, carbohydrate storage metabolism were observed as well as the concomitant accumulation of metabolites, such as oxalic acid, malate and isocitrate. Our data suggest that early metabolic changes in the resistance of Q. pubescens to drought involve a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle shunt through the glyoxylate pathway, galactose metabolism by reducing carbohydrate storage and increased proteolytic activity.","Jean-Philippe Mévy,Jean-Philippe Mévy,Béatrice Loriod,Béatrice Loriod,Xi Liu,Xi Liu,Erwan Corre,Erwan Corre,Erwan Corre,Erwan Corre,Magali Torres,Magali Torres,Michael Büttner,Michael Büttner,Michael Büttner,Romain David,Anne Haguenauer,Anne Haguenauer,Anne Haguenauer,Anne Haguenauer,Ilja M.

Canopy arthropod communities are a major constituent of biodiversity and show great variation in time and space according to different factors. Recently, genetic variation within tree species has attracted attention as a significant factor determining the diversity and composition of canopy arthropod communities. A major source of genetic and phenotypic novelty in plant species is interspecific hybridization, and therefore it is of interest to evaluate how this process affects the communities of associated organisms. In this study, we used microsatellite markers and geometric morphometry of leaf shape to analyze genetic and morphological variation in 45 individuals in a local hybrid zone between the oaks Quercus affinis and Q. laurina in Mexico. Individual trees were assigned to one of the parental species or to the hybrid category. The percentage of leaf area removed by herbivores was quantified in each individual and the canopies of five individuals of each categeory (two parental species and hybrids) was fogged with insecticide to assess the diversity and composition of arthropod communities. Results indicated that hybrid trees experience higher levels of herbivory than parental species and also sustain a higher abundance and richness of canopy arthropods. In general, our study supports the “hybrid susceptibility hypothesis” that predicts a higher incidence of associated arthropods on hybrid plants than in their parental species as result of the disruption of co-adapted gene complexes associated to resistance traits.","Yurixhi Maldonado-López,Yurixhi Maldonado-López,Marcela Sofía Vaca-Sánchez,Marcela Sofía Vaca-Sánchez,Antonio González‐Rodríguez,Antonio González-Rodríguez,Ken Oyama,Ken Oyama,Edmundo Carlos López-Barbosa,Edmundo López-Barbosa,Marcílio Fagundes,Marcílio Fagundes,Pablo Cuevas‐Reyes,Pablo Cuevas-Reyes",Journal of Insect Conservation,2018

The last decades have been marked by a decline in this species. Implementation of breeding programs is fundamental to revert this trend. Somatic embryogenesis is the system of choice for clonal propagation, constituting a valuable tool for embryo production and improved genotype testing. In this study, the cork oak transcriptome during somatic embryogenesis was characterized in four stages of development to identify relevant genes in the process and to understand the molecular and biochemical events occurring in each specific stage. A total 66,693 candidate coding regions were predicted from the generated de novo transcriptome assembly. Differential gene expression analysis identified 11,507 genes distributed in 30 clusters with distinct gene expression patterns and enriched in various biological process GO terms. Results show 1159 differentially expressed genes coding for transcription regulators, namely transcription factors (76%) with important roles in embryogenesis, like orthologous of AINTEGUMENTA-like, PLETHORA, CYTOKININ RESPONSE FACTOR, GATA transcription factors, and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs genes. Results also show 250 differentially expressed phytohormone-related genes involved in important aspects of embryogenesis as tissue specification, differentiation, and embryogenesis competence. Finally, we identified a group of genes with functions in cellular protection and abiotic stress tolerance coding for LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT proteins. Cork oak embryogenesis transcriptome characterization represents a tool for future biotechnological applications.

Due to extensive hybridization and introgression, it is considered to be one of the most challenging plant taxa, both taxonomically and phylogenetically. Quercus aquifolioides is an evergreen sclerophyllous oak species that is endemic to, but widely distributed across, the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in the Eastern Himalayas. Here, we compared the fully assembled chloroplast (cp) genome of Q. aquifolioides with those of three closely related species. The analysis revealed a cp genome ranging in size from 160,415 to 161,304 bp and with a typical quadripartite structure, composed of two inverted repeats (IRs) separated by a small single copy (SSC) and a large single copy (LSC) region. The genome organization, gene number, gene order, and GC content of these four Quercus cp genomes are similar to those of many angiosperm cp genomes. We also analyzed the Q. aquifolioides repeats and microsatellites. Investigating the effects of selection events on shared protein-coding genes using the Ka/Ks ratio showed that significant positive selection had acted on the atpF gene of Q. aquifolioides compared to two deciduous oak species, and that there had been significant purifying selection on the atpF gene in the chloroplast of evergreen sclerophyllous oak trees. In addition, site-specific selection analysis identified positively selected sites in 12 genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on shared protein-coding genes from 14 species defined Q. aquifolioides as belonging to sect. Heterobalanus and being closely related to Q. rubra and Q. aliena. Our findings provide valuable genetic information for use in accurately identifying species, resolving taxonomy, and reconstructing the phylogeny of the genus Quercus.","Kangquan Yin,Kangquan Yin,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang,Yuejuan Li,Yuejuan Li,Fang Du,Fang K.

10.1073/pnas.1908771116,31767740,,Adaptational lag to temperature in valley oak (Quercus lobata) can be mitigated by genome-informed assisted gene flow,"Climate change over the next century is predicted to cause widespread maladaptation in natural systems. This prediction, as well as many sustainable management and conservation practices, assumes that species are adapted to their current climate. However, this assumption is rarely tested. Using a large-scale common garden experiment combined with genome-wide sequencing, we found that valley oak (Quercus lobata), a foundational tree species in California ecosystems, showed a signature of adaptational lag to temperature, with fastest growth rates occurring at cooler temperatures than populations are currently experiencing. Future warming under realistic emissions scenarios was predicted to lead to further maladaptation to temperature and reduction in growth rates for valley oak. We then identified genotypes predicted to grow relatively fast under warmer temperatures and demonstrated that selecting seed sources based on their genotype has the potential to mitigate predicted negative consequences of future climate warming on growth rates in valley oak. These results illustrate that the belief of local adaptation underlying many management and conservation practices, such as using local seed sources for restoration, may not hold for some species. If contemporary adaptational lag is commonplace, we will need new approaches to help alleviate predicted negative consequences of climate warming on natural systems. We present one such approach, “genome-informed assisted gene flow,” which optimally matches individuals to future climates based on genotype–phenotype–environment associations.","Luke Browne,Luke Browne,Jessica W.

Oaks are notorious for interspecific hybridization and introgression, and complex speciation patterns involving incomplete lineage sorting. Therefore, accurately identifying Quercus species barcodes has been unsuccessful. In this study, we used chloroplast genome sequence data to identify molecular markers for oak species identification. Using next generation sequencing methods, we sequenced 14 chloroplast genomes of Quercus species in this study and added 10 additional chloroplast genome sequences from GenBank to develop a DNA barcode for oaks. Chloroplast genome sequence divergence was low. We identified four mutation hotspots as candidate Quercus DNA barcodes; two intergenic regions (matK-trnK-rps16 and trnR-atpA) were located in the large single copy region, and two coding regions (ndhF and ycf1b) were located in the small single copy region. The standard plant DNA barcode (rbcL and matK) had lower variability than that of the newly identified markers.

10.1111/mec.15289,31652373,,Seedling response to water stress in valley oak ( Quercus lobata ) is shaped by different gene networks across populations,"Drought is a major stress for plants, creating a strong selection pressure for traits that enable plant growth and survival in dry environments. Many drought responses are conserved species-wide responses, while others vary among populations distributed across heterogeneous environments. We tested how six populations of the widely distributed California valley oak (Quercus lobata) sampled from contrasting climates would differ in their response to soil drying relative to well-watered controls in a common environment by measuring ecophysiological traits in 93 individuals and gene expression (RNA-seq) in 42 individuals. Populations did not differ in their adjustment of turgor loss point during soil drying, suggesting a generalized species-wide response. Differential expression analysis identified 689 genes with a common response to treatment across populations and 470 genes with population-specific responses. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified groups of genes with similar expression patterns that may be regulated together (gene modules). Several gene modules responded differently to water stress among populations, suggesting regional differences in gene network regulation. Populations from sites with a high mean annual temperature responded to the imposed water stress with significantly greater changes in gene module expression, indicating that these populations may be locally adapted to respond to drought. We propose that this variation among valley oak populations provides a mechanism for differential tolerance to the increasingly frequent and severe droughts in California.","Alayna Mead,Alayna Mead,Juan Peñaloza Ramirez,Juan Peñaloza Ramirez,Megan K.

For this purpose, we successfully tested chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites initially developed for other oak species. We identified a set of markers that can be efficiently used for species identification and study of hybridization. Haplotypes based on the chloroplast microsatellites could resolve different maternal lineages and distinguish between the two sections represented in the study area. Using the nuclear microsatellites, we described patterns of genetic diversity across species with the endemic Q. alnifolia exhibiting reduced genetic diversity. Additionally, we employed a multivariate analysis, which could clearly differentiate among the three species. The two intermediate individuals clustered within the point cloud of Q. infectoria ssp. veneris and also possessed a chloroplast haplotype typical for this species. Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis of intersectional hybridization and interpreted their phenotypic appearance as the result of high phenotypic plasticity within Q. infectoria ssp. veneris .","Charalambos Neophytou,Simon Jansen,Ralf Hand,Georgia Chrysostomou,Konstantinos Iosif,Charalambos S.

Regardless of its ecological and economic importance, little is known about the genomes of species in this unique oak lineage. Quercus glauca is one of the most widespread tree species in the section Cyclobalanopsis. In this study, a high-quality haplotype-resolved reference genome was assembled for Q. glauca from PacBio HiFi and Hi-C reads. The genome size, contig N50, and scaffold N50 measured 902.88, 7.60, and 69.28 Mb, respectively, for haplotype1, and 913.28, 7.20, and 71.53 Mb, respectively, for haplotype2. A total of 37,457 and 38,311 protein-coding genes were predicted in haplotype1 and haplotype2, respectively. Homologous chromosomes in the Q. glauca genome had excellent gene pair collinearity. The number of R-genes in Q. glauca was similar to most East Asian oaks but less than oak species from Europe and America. Abundant structural variation in the Q. glauca genome could contribute to environmental stress tolerance in Q. glauca. Sections Cyclobalanopsis and Cerris diverged in the Oligocene, in agreement with fossil records for section Cyclobalanopsis, which document its presence in East Asia since the early Miocene. The demographic dynamics of closely related oak species were largely similar. The high-quality reference genome provided here for the most widespread species in section Cyclobalanopsis will serve as an essential genomic resource for evolutionary studies of key oak lineages while also supporting studies of interspecific introgression, local adaptation, and speciation in oaks.","Chang-Sha Luo,Tian-Tian Li,Xiao‐Long Jiang,Ying Song,Ting-Ting Fan,Xiang-Bao Shen,Rong Yi,Xiao-Ping Ao,Gang-Biao Xu,Min Deng",Molecular Ecology Resources,2023
10.7717/peerj.1897,27123376,,Plastome data reveal multiple geographic origins of Quercus Group Ilex,"Nucleotide sequences from the plastome are currently the main source for assessing taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships in flowering plants and their historical biogeography at all hierarchical levels. One major exception is the large and economically important genus Quercus (oaks). Whereas differentiation patterns of the nuclear genome are in agreement with morphology and the fossil record, diversity patterns in the plastome are at odds with established taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. However, the extent and evolutionary implications of this incongruence has yet to be fully uncovered. The DNA sequence divergence of four Euro-Mediterranean Group Ilex oak species (Quercus ilex L., Q. coccifera L., Q. aucheri Jaub. & Spach., Q. alnifolia Poech.) was explored at three chloroplast markers (rbcL, trnK/matK, trnH-psbA). Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed including worldwide members of additional 55 species representing all Quercus subgeneric groups. Family and order sequence data were harvested from gene banks to better frame the observed divergence in larger taxonomic contexts. We found a strong geographic sorting in the focal group and the genus in general that is entirely decoupled from species boundaries. High plastid divergence in members of Quercus Group Ilex, including haplotypes shared with related, but long isolated oak lineages, point towards multiple geographic origins of this group of oaks. The results suggest that incomplete lineage sorting and repeated phases of asymmetrical introgression among ancestral lineages of Group Ilex and two other main Groups of Eurasian oaks (Cyclobalanopsis and Cerris) caused this complex pattern. Comparison with the current phylogenetic synthesis also suggests an initial high- versus mid-latitude biogeographic split within Quercus. High plastome plasticity of Group Ilex reflects geographic area disruptions, possibly linked with high tectonic activity of past and modern distribution ranges, that did not leave imprints in the nuclear genome of modern species and infrageneric lineages.","Marco Cosimo Simeone,Marco Cosimo Simeone,Guido W.

In recent work, we used a RAD-seq based phylogeny including 250 species sampled from throughout the Americas and Eurasia to reconstruct the timing and biogeography of the North American oak radiation. This work demonstrates that the North American oak flora comprises mostly regional species radiations with limited phylogenetic affinities to Mexican clades, and two sister group connections to Eurasia. Using this framework, we describe the regional patterns of oak diversity within North America and formally classify 62 species into nine major North American subsections within sections Lobatae (the red oaks) and Quercus (the white oaks), the two largest sections of subgenus Quercus.

10.1111/eva.13650,38524684,,Ex situ conservation of two rare oak species using microsatellite and SNP markers,"Abstract Plant collections held by botanic gardens and arboreta are key components of ex situ conservation. Maintaining genetic diversity in such collections allows them to be used as resources for supplementing wild populations. However, most recommended minimum sample sizes for sufficient ex situ genetic diversity are based on microsatellite markers, and it remains unknown whether these sample sizes remain valid in light of more recently developed next‐generation sequencing (NGS) approaches. To address this knowledge gap, we examine how ex situ conservation status and sampling recommendations differ when derived from microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in garden and wild samples of two threatened oak species. For Quercus acerifolia, SNPs show lower ex situ representation of wild allelic diversity and slightly lower minimum sample size estimates than microsatellites, while results for each marker are largely similar for Q. boyntonii. The application of missing data filters tends to lead to higher ex situ representation, while the impact of different SNP calling approaches is dependent on the species being analyzed. Measures of population differentiation within species are broadly similar between markers, but larger numbers of SNP loci allow for greater resolution of population structure and clearer assignment of ex situ individuals to wild source populations. Our results offer guidance for future ex situ conservation assessments utilizing SNP data, such as the application of missing data filters and the usage of a reference genome, and illustrate that both microsatellites and SNPs remain viable options for botanic gardens and arboreta seeking to ensure the genetic diversity of their collections.","Austin C.

They are keystone species in many ecosystems. Species delimitation and phylogenetic studies of this genus are difficult owing to frequent hybridization. With an increasing number of genetic resources, we will gain a deeper understanding of this genus. In the present study, we collected four Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis species (Q. poilanei, Q. helferiana, Q. camusiae, and Q. semiserrata) distributed in Southeast Asia and sequenced their complete genomes. Following analysis, we compared the results with those of other species in the genus Quercus. These four chloroplast genomes ranged from 160,784 bp (Q. poilanei) to 161,632 bp (Q. camusiae) in length, with an overall guanine and cytosine (GC) content of 36.9%. Their chloroplast genomic organization and order, as well as their GC content, were similar to those of other Quercus species. We identified seven regions with relatively high variability (rps16, ndhk, accD, ycf1, psbZ—trnG-GCC, rbcL—accD, and rpl32—trnL-UAG) which could potentially serve as plastid markers for further taxonomic and phylogenetic studies within Quercus. Our phylogenetic tree supported the idea that the genus Quercus forms two well-differentiated lineages (corresponding to the subgenera Quercus and Cerris). Of the three sections in the subgenus Cerris, the section Ilex was split into two clusters, each nested in the other two sections. Moreover, Q. camusiae and Q. semiserrata detected in this study diverged first in the section Cyclobalanopsis and mixed with Q. engleriana in the section Ilex. In particular, 11 protein coding genes (atpF, ndhA, ndhD, ndhF, ndhK, petB, petD, rbcL, rpl22, ycf1, and ycf3) were subjected to positive selection pressure. Overall, this study enriches the chloroplast genome resources of Quercus, which will facilitate further analyses of phylogenetic relationships in this ecologically important tree genus.","Ling-Ling Wang,Yu Li,Si-Si Zheng,Gregor Kozlowski,Jin Xu,Yi-Gang Song",Genes,2024

Historical allele exchange, however, has not been fully characterised and the complex genomic signals resulting from the combination of vertical and horizontal gene transmission may confound phylogenetic inference and obscure our ability to accurately infer the deep evolutionary history of oaks. Using anchored enrichment, we obtained a phylogenomic dataset consisting of hundreds of single-copy nuclear loci. Concatenation, species-tree and network analyses were carried out in an attempt to uncover the genomic signal of ancient introgression and infer the divergent phylogenetic topology for the white oak clade. Locus and site-level likelihood comparisons were then conducted to further explore the introgressed signal within our dataset. Historical, intersectional gene flow is suggested to have occurred between an ancestor of the Eurasian Roburoid lineage and Quercus pontica and North American Dumosae and Prinoideae lineages.

Second, we use causal modelling to analyse the potential influence of climatic factors (current and LGM niche suitability) and altitude in the observed patterns of genetic structure. We found that genetic diversity is negatively associated with local climatic stability since the LGM, which may be due to higher immigration rates in unstable patches during favourable climatic periods and ⁄or temporally varying selection. Analyses of spatial genetic structure revealed the presence of three main genetic clusters, a pattern that is mainly driven by two highly differentiated populations located in the northern edge of the species distribution range. After controlling for geographic distance, causal modelling analyses showed that genetic relatedness decreases with the environmental divergence among sampling sites estimated as altitude and current and LGM niche suitability. Natural selection against nonlocal genotypes and ⁄or asynchrony in reproductive phenology may explain this pattern. Overall, this study suggests that local environmental conditions can shape patterns of genetic structure and variability even in species with high potential for gene flow and relatively small distribution ranges.","Joaquín Ortego,Joaquín Ortego,Erin C.

J. This scrub oak species has survived over the past 10,000 years in a region in which the climate has become increasingly xeric. While more prevalent after the last ice age, its US range is now limited to a handful of populations in one county in West Texas. This study examines the genetic diversity of the relict metapopulation and resultant conservation implications. We used microsatellites to genotype a total of 204 ramets collected from three locations in Presidio County, TX, that represent all known occurrences of Q. hinckleyi. Analyses of eight loci were used to determine levels of genetic variability, population structure and clonal growth.

However, the key genes and molecular regulatory mechanisms for leaf color transition remain to be investigated. First, we presented a high-quality chromosome-scale assembly for Q. dentata. This 893.54 Mb sized genome (contig N50 = 4.21 Mb, scaffold N50 = 75.55 Mb; 2n = 24) harbors 31 584 protein-coding genes. Second, our metabolome analyses uncovered pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside as the main pigments involved in leaf color transition. Third, gene co-expression further identified the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) transcription activation complex as central to anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation. Notably, transcription factor (TF) QdNAC (QD08G038820) was highly co-expressed with this MBW complex and may regulate anthocyanin accumulation and chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence through direct interaction with another TF, QdMYB (QD01G020890), as revealed by our further protein-protein and DNA-protein interaction assays. Our high-quality genome assembly, metabolome, and transcriptome resources further enrich Quercus genomics and will facilitate upcoming exploration of ornamental values and environmental adaptability in this important genus.","Wen‐Bo Wang,Xiangfeng He,Xuemei Yan,Bo Ma,Cunfu Lu,Jing Wu,Yi Zheng,Wenhe Wang,Wenbo Xue,Xue Tian,Jing‐Fang Guo,Yousry A.

10.3390/f12101425,,,Impact of Gene Flow and Introgression on the Range Wide Genetic Structure of Quercus robur (L.) in Europe,"As for most other temperate broadleaved tree species, large-scale genetic inventories of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) have focused on the plastidial genome, which showed the impact of post-glacial recolonization and manmade seed transfer. However, how have pollen mediated gene flow and introgression impacted the large-scale genetic structure? To answer these questions, we did a genetic inventory on 1970 pedunculate oak trees from 197 locations in 13 European countries. All samples were screened with a targeted sequencing approach on a set of 381 polymorphic loci (356 nuclear SNPs, 3 nuclear InDels, 17 chloroplast SNPs, and 5 mitochondrial SNPs). In a former analysis with additional 1763 putative Quercus petraea trees screened for the same gene markers we obtained estimates on the species admixture of all pedunculate oak trees. We identified 13 plastidial haplotypes, which showed a strong spatial pattern with a highly significant autocorrelation up to a range of 1250 km. Significant spatial genetic structure up to 1250 km was also observed at the nuclear loci. However, the differentiation at the nuclear gene markers was much lower compared to the organelle gene markers. The matrix of genetic distances among locations was partially correlated between nuclear and organelle genomes. Bayesian clustering analysis revealed the best fit to the data for a sub-division into two gene pools. One gene pool is dominating the west and the other is the most abundant in the east. The western gene pool was significantly influenced by introgression from Quercus petraea in the past. In Germany, we identified a contact zone of pedunculate oaks with different introgression intensity, likely resulting from different historical levels of introgression in glacial refugia or during postglacial recolonization. The main directions of postglacial recolonization were south to north and south to northwest in West and Central Europe, and for the eastern haplotypes also east to west in Central Europe. By contrast, the pollen mediated gene flow and introgression from Q. petraea modified the large-scale structure at the nuclear gene markers with significant west–east direction.","Бернд Деген,Bernd Degen,Yulai Yanbaev,Yulai Yanbaev,Malte Mäder,Malte Mader,Ruslan Ianbaev,Ruslan Ianbaev,Svetlana Bakhtina,Svetlana Bakhtina,Hilke Schroeder,Hilke Schroeder,Céline Blanc-Jolivet,Céline Blanc-Jolivet",Forests,2021

In plants, the two PFK members are ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP). However, the functions of the PFK family members in Quercus rubra are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genome-wide distribution of the PFK family members and their roles in Q. rubra by performing a systematic study of the phylogenetic relationships, molecular characteristics, motifs, chromosomal and subcellular locations, and cis- elements of QrPFKs . We identified 14 QrPFK genes in the genome of Q. rubra , followed by examining their expression in different tissues, including the roots, stems, and leaves.

To understand historical and future evolutionary and ecological responses to climate, we compared the association of geography and climate of three oak species (Quercus engelmannii, Quercus berberidifolia, and Quercus cornelius-mulleri) in an environmentally heterogeneous region of southern California at three organizational levels: regional species distributions, genetic variation, and phenotypic variation.We identified climatic variables influencing regional distribution patterns using species distribution models (SDMs), and then tested whether those individual variables are important in shaping genetic (microsatellite) and phenotypic (leaf morphology) variation. We estimated the relative contributions of geography and climate using multivariate redundancy analyses (RDA) with variance partitioning.The modeled distribution of each species was influenced by climate differently. Our analysis of genetic variation using RDA identified small but significant associations between genetic variation with climate and geography in Q. engelmannii and Q. cornelius-mulleri, but not in Q. berberidifolia, and climate explained more of the variation. Our analysis of phenotypic variation in Q. engelmannii indicated that climate had more impact than geography, but not in Q. berberidifolia. Throughout our analyses, we did not find a consistent pattern in effects of individual climatic variables.Our comparative analysis illustrates that climate influences tree response at all organizational levels, but the important climate factors vary depending on the level and on the species. Because of these species-specific and level-specific responses, today's sympatric species are unlikely to have similar distributions in the future.","Erin C. Riordan,E. C. Riordan,Paul F.

We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co-occurring spe- cies are more distantly related than expected by chance, and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence, communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the oak clades than only members of one clade. white live This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits im- portant for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence.

10.15287/afr.2014.171,,,Interspecific gene flow and maintenance of species integrity in oaks,"Oak species show a wide variation in morphological and physiological characters, and species boundariesbetween closely related species are often not clear-cut. Still, despite frequent interspecific gene flow, oaksmaintain distinct morphological and physiological adaptations. In sympatric stands, spatial distribution ofspecies with different ecological requirements is not random but constrained by soil and other microenvironmentalfactors. Pre-zygotic isolation (e.g. cross incompatibilities, asynchrony in flowering, pollen competition) and post-zygotic isolation (divergent selection) contribute to the maintenance of speciesintegrity in sympatric oak stands. The antagonistic effects of interspecific gene flow and divergentselection are reflected in the low genetic differentiation between hybridizing oak species at most genomic regions interspersed by regions with signatures of divergent selection (outlier regions). In the near future,the availability of high-density genetic linkage maps anchored to scaffolds of a sequenced Q. roburgenome will allow to characterize the underlying genes in these outlier regions and their putative role inreproductive isolation between species. Reciprocal transplant experiments of seedlings between parentalenvironments can be used to characterize selection on outlier genes.

The size of the Q. acutissima chloroplast genome is 161,124 bp, including one large single copy (LSC) region of 90,423 bp and one small single copy (SSC) region of 19,068 bp, separated by two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 51,632 bp. The GC content of the whole genome is 36.08%, while those of LSC, SSC, and IR are 34.62%, 30.84%, and 42.78%, respectively.

Yet examination of these linkages remains challenging due to the contrasting nature of focal systems and research approaches. Model clades provide a critical means to integrate ecology and evolution, as illustrated by the oaks (genus Quercus), an important model clade, given their ecological dominance, remarkable diversity, and growing phylogenetic, genomic, and ecological data resources. Studies of the clade reveal that their history of sympatric parallel adaptive radiation continues to influence community assembly today, highlighting questions on the nature and extent of coexistence mechanisms. Flexible phenology and hydraulic traits, despite evolutionary stasis, may have enabled adaptation to a wide range of environments within and across species, contributing to their high abundance and diversity. The oaks offer fundamental insights at the intersection of ecology and evolution on the role of diversification in community assembly processes, on the importance of flexibility in key functional traits in adapting to new environments, on factors contributing to persistence of long-lived organisms, and on evolutionary legacies that influence ecosystem function.","Jeannine Cavender‐Bares,Jeannine Cavender-Bares",New Phytologist,2019

Phenotypic plasticity, recent species divergence, and hybridization may all contribute to the unclear species boundaries in red oaks. We applied twenty-eight genomic and gene-basedmicrosatellites, including outlier loci with potential roles in reproductive isolation and adaptive divergence between species, to natural populations of four monophyletic interfertile oak species: Quercus ellipsoidalis, Q. coccinea, Q. rubra, and Q. velutina. To better resolve the taxonomic relationships in this difficult clade, we assigned individual samples to species, identified hybrids and introgressive forms, and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the four species after exclusion of genetically intermediate individuals. Genetic assignment analyses identified four distinct species clusters, with Q. rubra most differentiated from the three other species. However, especially between Q. ellipsoidalis and Q. velutina, a comparatively large number of misclassified individuals (7.14%), hybrids (7.14%), and introgressive forms (18.83%) were detected. After the exclusion of genetically intermediate individuals, Q. ellipsoidalis grouped as sister species to the largely parapatric Q. coccinea with high bootstrap support (91%). Genetically intermediate forms in a mixed species stand were located proximate to both potential parental species, which supports recent hybridization of Q. velutina with both Q. ellipsoidalis and Q. rubra. Analyses of genome-wide patterns of interspecific differentiation can provide a better understanding of speciation processes and taxonomic relationships in this taxonomically difficult group of red oak species.","Sandra A.

10.1111/evo.12758,26299374,,Historical introgression among the American live oaks and the comparative nature of tests for introgression.,"Introgressive hybridization challenges the concepts we use to define species and infer phylogenetic relationships. Methods for inferring historical introgression from the genomes of extant species, such as ABBA-BABA tests, are widely used, however, their results can be easily misinterpreted. Because these tests are inherently comparative, they are sensitive to the effects of missing data (unsampled species) and nonindependence (hierarchical relationships among species). We demonstrate this using genomic RADseq data sampled from all extant species in the American live oaks (Quercus series Virentes), a group notorious for hybridization. By considering all species and their phylogenetic relationships, we were able to distinguish true hybridizing lineages from those that falsely appear admixed. Six of seven species show evidence of admixture, often with multiple other species, but which is explained by introgression among a few related lineages occurring in close proximity. We identify the Cuban oak as the most admixed lineage and test alternative scenarios for its origin. The live oaks form a continuous ring-like distribution around the Gulf of Mexico, connected in Cuba, across which they could effectively exchange alleles. However, introgression appears highly localized, suggesting that oak species boundaries and their geographic ranges have remained relatively stable over evolutionary time.","Deren A. R.

10.1111/mec.13563,26833902,,Species-wide patterns of DNA methylation variation in Quercus lobata and their association with climate gradients,"DNA methylation in plants affects transposon silencing, transcriptional regulation and thus phenotypic variation. One unanswered question is whether DNA methylation could be involved in local adaptation of plant populations to their environments. If methylation alters phenotypes to improve plant response to the environment, then methylation sites or the genes that affect them could be a target of natural selection. Using reduced-representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) data, we assessed whether climate is associated with variation in DNA methylation levels among 58 naturally occurring, and species-wide samples of valley oak (Quercus lobata) collected across climate gradients. We identified the genomic context of these variants referencing a new draft valley oak genome sequence. Methylation data were obtained for 341107 cytosines, of which we deemed 57488 as single-methylation variants (SMVs), found in the CG, CHG and CHH sequence contexts. Environmental association analyses revealed 43 specific SMVs that are significantly associated with any of four climate variables, the majority of which are associated with mean maximum temperature. The 43 climate-associated SMVs tend to occur in or near genes, several of which have known involvement in plant response to environment. Multivariate analyses show that climate and spatial variables explain more overall variance in CG-SMVs among individuals than in SNPs, CHG-SMVs or CHH-SMVs. Together, these results from natural oak populations provide initial evidence for a role of CG methylation in locally adaptive evolution or plasticity in plant response.","Paul F. Gugger,Paul F.

Over 49 million reads provided by Roche 454 GS-FLX technology were assembled into contigs and combined with shorter Illumina sequence reads from paired-end and mate-pair libraries of different insert sizes, to build scaffolds. Errors were corrected and gaps filled with Illumina paired-end reads and contaminants detected, resulting in a total of 17910 scaffolds (>2kb) corresponding to 1.34Gb. Fifty per cent of the assembly was accounted for by 1468 scaffolds (N50 of 260kb). Initial comparison with the phylogenetically related Prunus persica gene model indicated that genes for 84.6% of the proteins present in peach (mean protein coverage of 90.5%) were present in our assembly. The second and third steps in this project are genome annotation and the assignment of scaffolds to the oak genetic linkage map. In accordance with the Bermuda and Fort Lauderdale agreements and the more recent Toronto Statement, the oak genome data have been released into public sequence repositories in advance of publication. In this presubmission paper, the oak genome consortium describes its principal lines of work and future directions for analyses of the nature, function and evolution of the oak genome.","Christophe Plomion,Christophe Plomion,Jean‐Marc Aury,Jean-Marc Aury,Joëlle Amselem,Joelle Amselem,Tina Alaeitabar,Tina Alaeitabar,Valérie Barbe,Valérie Barbe,Valérie Barbe,Caroline Belser,Caroline Belser,Hélène Bergès,Hélène Bergès,Catherine Bodénès,Catherine Bodénès,Catherine Bodénès,Nathalie Boudet,Nathalie Boudet,Nathalie Boudet,Christophe Boury,Christophe Boury,Aurélie Canaguier,Aurélie Canaguier,Arnaud Couloux,Arnaud Couloux,Corinne Da Silva,Corinne Da Silva,Sébastien Duplessis,Sébastien Duplessis,François Ehrenmann,François Ehrenmann,Barbara Estrada-Mairey,Barbara Estrada-Mairey,Stéphanie Fouteau,Stéphanie Fouteau,Nicolas Francillonne,Nicolas Francillonne,Christine Gaspin,Christine Gaspin,Cécile Guichard,Cecile Guichard,Cécile Guichard,Christophe Klopp,Christophe Klopp,Karine Labadie,Karine Labadie,Céline Lalanne,Céline Lalanne,Isabelle Le Clainche,Isabelle Le Clainche,Jean‐Charles Leplé,Jean-Charles Leplé,Grégoire Le Provost,Grégoire Le Provost,Grégoire Le Provost,Thibault Leroy,Thibault Leroy,Isabelle Lesur,Isabelle Lesur,Francis Martin,Francis Martin,Jonathan Mercier,Jonathan Mercier,Célia Michotey,Célia Michotey,Florent Murat,Florent Murat,Franck Salin,Franck Salin,Delphine Steinbach,Delphine Steinbach,Patricia Faivre-Rampant,Patricia Faivre-Rampant,Patrick Wincker,Patrick Wincker,Jérôme Salse,Jérôme Salse,Hadi Quesneville,Hadi Quesneville,Antoine Kremer,Antoine Kremer",Molecular Ecology Resources,2016
10.1038/sdata.2018.69,29786699,,The draft genome sequence of cork oak,"Cork oak (Quercus suber) is native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa where it plays a crucial environmental and economical role. To tackle the cork oak production and industrial challenges, advanced research is imperative but dependent on the availability of a sequenced genome. To address this, we produced the first draft version of the cork oak genome. We followed a de novo assembly strategy based on high-throughput sequence data, which generated a draft genome comprising 23,347 scaffolds and 953.3Mb in size. A total of 79,752 genes and 83,814 transcripts were predicted, including 33,658 high-confidence genes. An InterPro signature assignment was detected for 69,218 transcripts, which represented 82.6% of the total. Validation studies demonstrated the genome assembly and annotation completeness and highlighted the usefulness of the draft genome for read mapping of high-throughput sequence data generated using different protocols. All data generated is available through the public databases where it was deposited, being therefore ready to use by the academic and industry communities working on cork oak and/or related species.

10.1111/mec.13269,26095958,,Phylogeny and biogeography of the American live oaks (Quercus subsection Virentes): a genomic and population genetics approach.,"The nature and timing of evolution of niche differentiation among closely related species remains an important question in ecology and evolution. The American live oak clade, Virentes, which spans the unglaciated temperate and tropical regions of North America and Mesoamerica, provides an instructive system in which to examine speciation and niche evolution. We generated a fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Virentes using RADseq data to estimate divergence times and used nuclear microsatellites, chloroplast sequences and an intron region of nitrate reductase (NIA-i3) to examine genetic diversity within species, rates of gene flow among species and ancestral population size of disjunct sister species. Transitions in functional and morphological traits associated with ecological and climatic niche axes were examined across the phylogeny. We found the Virentes to be monophyletic with three subclades, including a southwest clade, a southeastern US clade and a Central American/Cuban clade. Despite high leaf morphological variation within species and transpecific chloroplast haplotypes, RADseq and nuclear SSR data showed genetic coherence of species. We estimated a crown date for Virentes of 11Ma and implicated the formation of the Sea of Cortes in a speciation event ~5Ma. Tree height at maturity, associated with fire tolerance, differs among the sympatric species, while freezing tolerance appears to have diverged repeatedly across the tropical–temperate divide. Sympatric species thus show evidence of ecological niche differentiation but share climatic niches, while allopatric and parapatric species conserve ecological niches, but diverge in climatic niches. The mode of speciation and/or degree of co-occurrence may thus influence which niche axis plants diverge along.","Jeannine Cavender‐Bares,Jeannine Cavender-Bares,Antonio González‐Rodríguez,Antonio González-Rodríguez,Deren A.

10.1002/ece3.4122,29938097,,A nuclear DNA barcode for eastern North American oaks and application to a study of hybridization in an Arboretum setting.,"DNA barcoding has proved difficult in a number of woody plant genera, including the ecologically important oak genus Quercus. In this study, we utilized restrictionsite‐associated DNA sequencing (RAD‐seq) to develop an economical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA barcoding system that suffices to distinguish eight common, sympatric eastern North American white oak species. Two de novo clustering pipelines, PyRAD and Stacks, were used in combination with postclustering bioinformatic tools to generate a list of 291 potential SNPs, 80 of which were included in a barcoding toolkit that is easily implemented using MassARRAY mass spectrometry technology. As a proof‐of‐concept, we used the genotyping toolkit to infer potential hybridization between North American white oaks transplanted outside of their native range (Q.michauxii, Q.montana, Q muehlenbergii/Q.prinoides, and Q.stellata) into a horticultural collection surrounded by natural forests of locally native trees (Q.alba and Q.macrocarpa) in the living collection at The Morton Arboretum (Lisle, IL, USA). Phylogenetic and clustering analyses suggested low rates of hybridization between cultivated and native species, with the exception of one Q.michauxii mother tree, the acorns of which exhibited high admixture from either Q.alba or Q.stellata and Q.macrocarpa, and a hybrid between Q.stellata that appears to have backcrossed almost exclusively to Q.alba. Together, RAD‐seq and MassARRAY technologies allow for efficient development and implementation of a multispecies barcode for one of the more challenging forest tree genera.","Elisabeth Fitzek,Elisabeth Fitzek,Adline Delcamp,Adline Delcamp,Erwan Guichoux,Erwan Guichoux,Erwan Guichoux,Marlene Hahn,Marlene Hahn,Matthew S.

10.1111/nph.16274,31630400,,Oaks: an evolutionary success story.,"The genus Quercus is among the most widespread and species-rich tree genera in the northern hemisphere. The extraordinary species diversity in America and Asia together with the continuous continental distribution of a limited number of European species raise questions about how macro- and microevolutionary processes made the genus Quercus an evolutionary success. Synthesizing conclusions reached during the past three decades by complementary approaches in phylogenetics, phylogeography, genomics, ecology, paleobotany, population biology and quantitative genetics, this review aims to illuminate evolutionary processes leading to the radiation and expansion of oaks. From opposing scales of time and geography, we converge on four overarching explanations of evolutionary success in oaks: accumulation of large reservoirs of diversity within populations and species; ability for rapid migration contributing to ecological priority effects on lineage diversification; high rates of evolutionary divergence within clades combined with convergent solutions to ecological problems across clades; and propensity for hybridization, contributing to adaptive introgression and facilitating migration. Finally, we explore potential future research avenues, emphasizing the integration of microevolutionary and macroevolutionary perspectives.","Antoine Kremer,Antoine Kremer,Andrew L. Hipp,Andrew L.

10.1038/s41477-018-0172-3,,,Oak genome reveals facets of long lifespan.,"Oaks are an important part of our natural and cultural heritage. Not only are they ubiquitous in our most common landscapes1 but they have also supplied human societies with invaluable services, including food and shelter, since prehistoric times2. With 450 species spread throughout Asia, Europe and America3, oaks constitute a critical global renewable resource. The longevity of oaks (several hundred years) probably underlies their emblematic cultural and historical importance. Such long-lived sessile organisms must persist in the face of a wide range of abiotic and biotic threats over their lifespans. We investigated the genomic features associated with such a long lifespan by sequencing, assembling and annotating the oak genome. We then used the growing number of whole-genome sequences for plants (including tree and herbaceous species) to investigate the parallel evolution of genomic characteristics potentially underpinning tree longevity. A further consequence of the long lifespan of trees is their accumulation of somatic mutations during mitotic divisions of stem cells present in the shoot apical meristems. Empirical4 and modelling5 approaches have shown that intra-organismal genetic heterogeneity can be selected for6 and provides direct fitness benefits in the arms race with short-lived pests and pathogens through a patchwork of intra-organismal phenotypes7. However, there is no clear proof that large-statured trees consist of a genetic mosaic of clonally distinct cell lineages within and between branches. Through this case study of oak, we demonstrate the accumulation and transmission of somatic mutations and the expansion of disease-resistance gene families in trees.","Christophe Plomion,Christophe Plomion,Jean‐Marc Aury,Jean-Marc Aury,Joëlle Amselem,Joelle Amselem,Thibault Leroy,Thibault Leroy,Florent Murat,Florent Murat,Sébastien Duplessis,Sébastien Duplessis,Sébastien Faye,Sébastien Faye,Nicolas Francillonne,Nicolas Francillonne,Karine Labadie,Karine Labadie,Grégoire Le Provost,Grégoire Le Provost,Isabelle Lesur,Isabelle Lesur,Isabelle Lesur Kupin,Jérôme Bartholomé,Jérôme Bartholomé,Patricia Faivre-Rampant,Patricia Faivre-Rampant,Patricia Faivre-Rampant,Annegret Kohler,Annegret Kohler,Jean‐Charles Leplé,Jean-Charles Leplé,Nathalie Chantret,Nathalie Chantret,Jun Chen,Jun Chen,Jun Chen,Anne Diévart,Anne Dievart,Tina Alaeitabar,Tina Alaeitabar,Valérie Barbe,Valérie Barbe,Valérie Barbe,Caroline Belser,Caroline Belser,Hélène Bergès,Hélène Bergès,Catherine Bodénès,Catherine Bodénès,Marie‐Béatrice Bogeat‐Triboulot,Marie-Béatrice Bogeat-Triboulot,Marie-Béatrice Bogeat-Triboulot,Marie-Lara Bouffaud,Marie-Lara Bouffaud,Benjamin Brachi,Benjamin Brachi,Émilie Chancerel,Emilie Chancerel,David Cohen,David Cohen,David Cohen,Arnaud Couloux,Arnaud Couloux,Corinne Da Silva,Corinne Da Silva,Carole Dossat,Carole Dossat,François Ehrenmann,François Ehrenmann,Christine Gaspin,Christine Gaspin,Jacqueline Grima‐Pettenati,Jacqueline Grima-Pettenati,Erwan Guichoux,Erwan Guichoux,Erwan Guichoux,Arnaud Hecker,Arnaud Hecker,Sylvie Herrmann,Sylvie Herrmann,Philippe Hugueney,Philippe Hugueney,Philippe Hugueney,Irène Hummel,Irène Hummel,Iréne Hummel,Christophe Klopp,Christophe Klopp,Céline Lalanne,Céline Lalanne,Céline Lalanne,Martin Lascoux,Martin Lascoux,Éric Lasserre,Eric Lasserre,Eric Lasserre,Arnaud Lemainque,Arnaud Lemainque,Arnaud Lemainque,Marie‐Laure Desprez‐Loustau,Marie-Laure Desprez-Loustau,Isabelle Luyten,Isabelle Luyten,Mohammed‐Amin Madoui,Mohammed-Amin Madoui,Sophie Mangenot,Sophie Mangenot,Clémence Marchal,Clémence Marchal,Clemence Marchal,Florian Maumus,Florian Maumus,Jonathan Mercier,Jonathan Mercier,Célia Michotey,Célia Michotey,Olivier Panaud,Olivier Panaud,Nathalie Picault,Nathalie Picault,Nathalie Picault,Nicolas Rouhier,Nicolas Rouhier,Olivier Rué,Olivier Rué,Olivier Rué,Olivier Rué,Camille Rustenholz,Camille Rustenholz,Camille Rustenholz,Franck Salin,Franck Salin,Marçal Soler,Marçal Soler,Mika Tarkka,Mika T.

10.3732/ajb.1100023,22174334,,"Genetic evidence for hybridization in red oaks (Quercus sect. Lobatae, Fagaceae)","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Hybridization is pervasive in many plant taxa, with consequences for species taxonomy, local adaptation, and management. Oaks (Quercus spp.) are thought to hybridize readily yet retain distinct traits, drawing into question the biological species concept for such taxa, but the true extent of gene flow is controversial. Genetic data are beginning to shed new light on this issue, but red oaks (section Lobatae), an important component of North American forests, have largely been neglected. Moreover, gene flow estimates may be sensitive to the choice of life stage, marker type, or genetic structure statistic. METHODS: We coupled genetic structure data with parentage analyses for two mixed-species stands in North Carolina. Genetic structure analyses of adults (including F(ST), R(ST), G'(ST), and structure) reflect long-term patterns of gene flow, while the percentage of seedlings with parents of two different species reflect current levels of gene flow. KEY RESULTS: Genetic structure analyses revealed low differentiation in microsatellite allele frequencies between co-occurring species, suggesting past gene flow. However, methods differed in their sensitivity to differentiation, indicating a need for caution when drawing conclusions from a single method. Parentage analyses identified >20% of seedlings as potential hybrids. The species examined exhibit distinct morphologies, suggesting selection against intermediate phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hybridization between co-occurring red oaks occurs, but that selection may limit introgression, especially at functional loci. However, by providing a source of genetic variation, hybridization could influence the response of oaks and other hybridizing taxa to environmental change.","Emily Moran,Emily V. Moran,John H.

Two sister oak species, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata, occur in sympatry in Florida and throughout the southeastern United States. In 11 sites from northern and southeastern regions of Florida, we used a leaf-based morphological index to identify individuals to species. Eleven nuclear microsatellite markers significantly differentiated between the species with a high correspondence between molecular and morphological typing of specimens. Nevertheless, Bayesian clustering analysis indicates interspecific gene flow, and six of 109 individuals had mixed ancestry. The identity of several individuals also was mismatched using molecular markers and morphological characters. In a common environment, the two species performed differently in terms of photosynthetic performance and growth, corresponding to their divergent ecological niches with respect to soil moisture and other edaphic properties. Our data support earlier hypotheses that divergence in flowering time causes assortative mating, allowing these ecologically distinct sister species to occur in sympatry. Limited gene flow that permits ecological differentiation helps to explain the overdispersion of oak species in local communities.","Jeannine Cavender‐Bares,Jeannine Cavender-Bares,Annette Pahlich,Annette Pahlich",American Journal of Botany,2009

We showed that the robustness of allele identification can be improved by binning on raw peak sizes prior to genetic data analysis. We checked through simulation the power of these markers for species delimitation and hybrid detection. The resolution achieved with all 20 markers was greatly improved compared to that of previous studies based on a subset of the markers. Preliminary PCR tests suggest that these multiplexes might be useful to study other oak species as well. The strategy used for multiplex microsatellite development (from PCR conditions to the definition of allele calling rules) should be broadly applicable.","Erwan Guichoux,Erwan Guichoux,Erwan Guichoux,L.

10.1111/mec.13889,27759957,,Signatures of local adaptation in candidate genes of oaks (Quercus spp.) with respect to present and future climatic conditions.,"Testing how populations are locally adapted and predicting their response to their future environment is of key importance in view of climate change. Landscape genomics is a powerful approach to investigate genes and environmental factors involved in local adaptation. In a pooled amplicon sequencing approach of 94 genes in 71 populations, we tested if >3'500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the three most common oak species in Switzerland (Quercus petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. robur) show an association with abiotic factors related to local topography, historical climate, and soil characteristics. In the analysis including all species, the most frequently associated environmental factors were those best describing the habitats of the species. In the species-specific analyses, the most important environmental factors and associated SNPs greatly differed among species. However, we identified one SNP and seven genes that were associated to the same environmental factor across all species. We finally used regressions of allele frequencies of the most strongly associated SNPs along environmental gradients to predict the risk of non-adaptedness (RONA), which represents the average change in allele frequency at climate-associated loci theoretically required to match future climatic conditions. RONA is considerable for some populations and species (up to 48% in single populations) and strongly differs among species. Given the long generation time of oaks, some of the required allele frequency changes might not be realistic to achieve based on standing genetic variation. Hence, future adaptedness requires gene flow or planting of individuals carrying beneficial alleles from habitats currently matching future climatic conditions.

10.1093/aob/mcu019,24615344,,Evidence for selection on a CONSTANS-like gene between two red oak species.,"† Background and Aims Hybridizing species such as oaks may provide a model to study the role of selection in speciation with gene flow. Discrete species’ identities and different adaptations are maintained among closely related oak species despite recurrent gene flow. This is probably due to ecologically mediated selection at a few key genes or genomic regions. Neutrality tests can be applied to identify so-called outlier loci, which demonstrate locus-specific signatures of divergent selection and are candidate genes for further study. † Methods Thirty-six genic microsatellite markers, some with putative functions in flowering time and drought tolerance, and eight non-genic microsatellite markers were screened in two population pairs (n ¼ 160) of the interfertile species Quercus rubra and Q. ellipsoidalis, which are characterized by contrasting adaptations to drought. Putative outliers were then tested in additional population pairs from two different geographic regions (n ¼ 159) to support further their potential role in adaptive divergence. † Key Results A marker located in the coding sequence of a putative CONSTANS-like (COL) gene was repeatedly identified as under strong divergent selection across all three geographically disjunct population pairs. COL genes are involved in the photoperiodic control of growth and development and are implicated in the regulation of flowering time. † Conclusions The location of the polymorphism in the Quercus COL gene and given the potential role of COL genes in adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation makes this a promising candidate speciation gene. Further investigation of the phenological characteristics of both species and flowering time pathway genes is suggested in order to elucidate the importance of phenology genes for the maintenance of species integrity. Next-generation sequencing in multiple population pairs in combination with high-density genetic linkage maps could reveal the genome-wide distribution of outlier genes and their potential role in reproductive isolation between these species.","Jennifer F.

10.1534/genetics.113.153783,23934884,,Imprints of Natural Selection Along Environmental Gradients in Phenology-Related Genes of Quercus petraea,"We explored single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in candidate genes for bud burst from Quercus petraea populations sampled along gradients of latitude and altitude in Western Europe. SNP diversity was monitored for 106 candidate genes, in 758 individuals from 32 natural populations. We investigated whether SNP variation reflected the clinal pattern of bud burst observed in common garden experiments. We used different methods to detect imprints of natural selection (FST outlier, clinal variation at allelic frequencies, association tests) and compared the results obtained for the two gradients. FST outlier SNPs were found in 15 genes, 5 of which were common to both gradients. The type of selection differed between the two gradients (directional or balancing) for 3 of these 5. Clinal variations were observed for six SNPs, and one cline was conserved across both gradients. Association tests between the phenotypic or breeding values of trees and SNP genotypes identified 14 significant associations, involving 12 genes. The results of outlier detection on the basis of population differentiation or clinal variation were not very consistent with the results of association tests. The discrepancies between these approaches may reflect the different hierarchical levels of selection considered (inter- and intrapopulation selection). Finally, we obtained evidence for convergent selection (similar for gradients) and clinal variation for a few genes, suggesting that comparisons between parallel gradients could be used to screen for major candidate genes responding to natural selection in trees.","Florian Alberto,Florian Alberto,Jérémy Derory,Jérémy Derory,Christophe Boury,Christophe Boury,Jean‐Marc Frigério,Jean-Marc Frigerio,Niklaus E.

We integrate multilocus phylogeography, climate-based ENMs and multivariate statistical approaches to infer the effects of late Quaternary climate change on contemporary genetic variation of valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee). ENMs indicated that valley oak maintained a stable distribution with local migration from the last interglacial period (~120ka) to the Last Glacial Maximum (~21ka, LGM) to the present compared with large-scale range shifts for an eastern North American white oak (Quercus alba L.). Coast Range and Sierra Nevada foothill populations diverged in the late Pleistocene before the LGM [104ka (28–1622)] and have occupied somewhat distinct climate niches, according to ENMs and coalescent analyses of divergence time. In accordance with neutral expectations for stable populations, nuclear microsatellite diversity positively correlated with niche stability from the LGM to present. Most strikingly, nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite variation significantly correlated with LGM climate, even after controlling for associations with geographic location and present climate using partial redundancy analyses. Variance partitioning showed that LGM climate uniquely explains a similar proportion of genetic variance as present climate (16% vs. 11–18%), and together, past and present climate explains more than geography (19%). Climate can influence local expansion–contraction dynamics, flowering phenology and thus gene flow, and/or impose selective pressures. These results highlight the lingering effect of past climate on genetic variation in species with stable distributions.","Paul F. Gugger,Paul F. Gugger,Makihiko Ikegami,Makihiko Ikegami,Victoria L.

10.1111/nph.14413,,,Extensive recent secondary contacts between four European white oak species.,"Historical trajectories of tree species during the late Quaternary have been well reconstructed through genetic and palaeobotanical studies. However, many congeneric tree species are interfertile, and the timing and contribution of introgression to species divergence during their evolutionary history remains largely unknown. We quantified past and current gene flow events between four morphologically divergent oak species (Quercus petraea, Q.robur, Q.pyrenaica, Q.pubescens), by two independent inference methods: diffusion approximation to the joint frequency spectrum (∂a∂i) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). For each pair of species, alternative scenarios of speciation allowing gene flow over different timescales were evaluated. Analyses of 3524 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) randomly distributed in the genome, showed that these species evolved in complete isolation for most of their history, but recently came into secondary contact, probably facilitated by the most recent period of postglacial warming. We demonstrated that: there was sufficient genetic differentiation before secondary contact for the accumulation of barriers to gene flow; and current European white oak genomes are a mosaic of genes that have crossed species boundaries and genes impermeable to gene flow.","Thibault Leroy,Thibault Leroy,Camille Roux,Camille Roux,Laure Villate,Laure Villate,Catherine Bodénès,Catherine Bodénès,Catherine Bodénès,Jonathan Romiguier,Jonathan Romiguier,Jorge A P Paiva,Jorge A.

However, it is unknown whether hybrids are transitory resulting from interspecific gene flow or whether they are maintained through extrinsic selection. Here, we examine cryptic hybrid structure in Q. wislizeni through a broad region including contact and isolation from three other western North American red oaks using amplified fragment length polymorphism molecular markers. All four species were simultaneously detected in the genetic background of individuals morphologically assigned to Q. wislizeni, although the contribution of Q. kelloggii was minor. In some cases, introgression was detected well outside the region of sympatry with one of the parental species. Molecular structure at the individual level indicated this was due to long-distance pollen dispersal and not to local extinction of parental species. Species admixture proportions were correlated with climatic variables and greater proportions of Q. agrifolia and Q. parvula were present in the genetic background of Q. wislizeni in sites with cooler and more humid summers, corresponding with habitat preferences of the parental species. Partial Mantel tests indicated that climate was more important than distance from pollen source in this association. Despite high levels of introgression, species integrity was maintained in some populations in close proximity to the other species, providing further support to environmental selection in determining population genetic structure. Thus, the contribution of species mixtures to population genetic structure varies across the landscape according to availability of pollen, but more importantly to varying environmental selection pressures that produce a complex pattern of hybrid and pure gene pools.","Richard S.

In this study, we reconstruct the first comprehensive phylogeny of this lineage using a genomic approach (restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, RAD-seq), sampling 35 of the ca. 90 species currently recognized, representing all main morphological groups of section Cyclobalanopsis. In addition, 10 other species of Quercus and two outgroups were also sampled. Divergence times were estimated using a relaxed clock model and two fossil calibrations. Ancestral areas and dispersal routes were inferred using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model. The phylogeny of Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis demonstrates the section to be monophyletic, comprising two main lineages and six subclades that are well supported by anatomical traits. Biogeographical reconstructions indicate that the wide northern hemisphere distribution of Quercus was disrupted in the Late Eocene, leading to the main extant groups at about 33Ma. The earliest divergences in section Cyclobalanopsis correspond to the phased uplift of the Himalayas and lateral extrusion of Indochina at the transition of the Oligocene and Miocene, where the highest rate of diversification occurred in the late Miocene. Dispersal from Sino-Himalaya and the Palaeotropics to Sino-Japan in the Miocene was facilitated by the increased intensity of East Asian summer monsoons and by the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. Our results highlight the importance of climatic changes and Indo-Eurasian collision-induced tectonic activities from the Neogene onward to the spatial-temporal diversification patterns of Asian EBLF lineages.","Min Deng,Min Deng,Xiao‐Long Jiang,Xiao-Long Jiang,Andrew L.

10.1002/ajb2.1049,,,The role of diversification in community assembly of the oaks (Quercus L.) across the continental U.S.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Evolutionary and biogeographic history, including past environmental change and diversification processes, are likely to have influenced the expansion, migration, and extinction of populations, creating evolutionary legacy effects that influence regional species pools and the composition of communities. We consider the consequences of the diversification process in shaping trait evolution and assembly of oak-dominated communities throughout the continental United States (U.S.). METHODS: Within the U.S. oaks, we tested for phylogenetic and functional trait patterns at different spatial scales, taking advantage of a dated phylogenomic analysis of American oaks and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). KEY RESULTS: We find (1) phylogenetic overdispersion at small grain sizes throughout the U.S. across all spatial extents and (2) a shift from overdispersion to clustering with increasing grain sizes. Leaf traits have evolved in a convergent manner, and these traits are clustered in communities at all spatial scales, except in the far west, where species with contrasting leaf types co-occur. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypotheses that (1) interspecific interactions were important in parallel adaptive radiation of the genus into a range of habitats across the continent and (2) that the diversification process is a critical driver of community assembly. Functional convergence of complementary species from distinct clades adapted to the same local habitats is a likely mechanism that allows distantly related species to coexist. Our findings contribute to an explanation of the long-term maintenance of high oak diversity and the dominance of the oak genus in North America.","Jeannine Cavender‐Bares,Jeannine Cavender-Bares,Shan Kothari,Shan Kothari,José Eduardo Meireles,Jose Eduardo Meireles,Matthew A.

The study was based on a total set of 389 markers (isozymes, AFLPs, SCARs, microsatellites, and SNPs) for which allelic frequencies were estimated in pairs of populations sampled throughout the sympatric distribution of the two species. The overall distribution of G ST values followed an L-shaped curve with most markers exhibiting low species differentiation ( G ST  10% levels. Twelve percent of the loci exhibited significant G ST deviations to neutral expectations, suggesting that selection contributed to species divergence. Coding regions expressed higher differentiation than noncoding regions. Among the 389 markers, 158 could be mapped on the 12 linkage groups of the existing Q. robur genetic map. Outlier loci with large G ST values were distributed over 9 linkage groups. One cluster of three outlier loci was found within 0.51 cM; but significant autocorrelation of G ST was observed at distances <2 cM.

10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00944.x,,,Hybridization as a mechanism of invasion in oaks,"Summary
We review here our own research and related work on hybridization between two widespread and largely sympatric European oak species (Quercus petraea and Q. robur). There is a near total lack of local differentiation in chloroplast DNA markers between them. A model is proposed to account for this lack of differentiation: invasion by one species of the range occupied by the other through pollen swamping. In support of this model, ecological, palaeoecological and population genetic studies indicate that one species (Q. robur) disperses its seeds better than the other one, that pollen flow is much more efficient than seed flow in oaks and that hybridization and introgression are asymmetric, hence reinforcing the ecological dynamics by facilitating the dispersal of Q. petraea in regions already colonized by Q. robur. ‘Resurrection’ of Q. petraea following this wave of hybridization appears to be rapid. More generally, available evidence indicates that hybridization could constitute an important mechanism of dispersal in both natural and human-induced plant invasions.","Rémy J. Petit,Rémy J.

10.1007/978-3-319-69099-5_2,,,An Updated Infrageneric Classification of the Oaks: Review of Previous Taxonomic Schemes and Synthesis of Evolutionary Patterns,"In this chapter, we review major classification schemes proposed for oaks by John Claudius Loudon, Anders Sandoe Orsted, William Trelease, Otto Karl Anton Schwarz, Aimee Antoinette Camus, Yuri Leonardovich Menitsky, and Kevin C. Nixon. Classifications of oaks (Fig. 2.1) have thus far been based entirely on morphological characters. They differed profoundly from each other because each taxonomist gave a different weight to distinguishing characters; often characters that are homoplastic in oaks. With the advent of molecular phylogenetics our view has considerably changed. One of the most profound changes has been the realisation that the traditional split between the East Asian subtropical to tropical subgenus Cyclobalanopsis and the subgenus Quercus that includes all other oaks is artificial. The traditional concept has been replaced by that of two major clades, each comprising three infrageneric groups: a Palearctic-Indomalayan clade including Group Ilex (Ilex oaks), Group Cerris (Cerris oaks) and Group Cyclobalanopsis (cycle-cup oaks), and a predominantly Nearctic clade including Group Protobalanus (intermediate or golden cup oaks), Group Lobatae (red oaks) and Group Quercus (white oaks, with most species in America and some 30 species in Eurasia). In addition, recent phylogenetic studies identified two distinct clades within a wider group of white oaks: the Virentes oaks of North America and a clade with two disjunct endemic species in western Eurasia and western North America, Quercus pontica and Q. sadleriana. The main morphological feature characterising these phylogenetic lineages is pollen morphology, a character overlooked in traditional classifications. This realisation, along with the now available (molecular-)phylogenetic framework, opens new avenues for biogeographic, ecological and evolutionary studies and a re-appraisal of the fossil record. We provide an overview about recent advances in these fields and outline how the results of these studies contribute to the establishment of a unifying systematic scheme of oaks. Ultimately, we propose an updated classification of Quercus recognising two subgenera with eight sections. This classification considers morphological traits, molecular-phylogenetic relationships, and the evolutionary history of one of the most important temperate woody plant genera.","Thomas Denk,Thomas Denk,Guido W.

10.1111/mec.13230,25951436,,Genome-wide signature of local adaptation linked to variable CpG methylation in oak populations,"It has long been known that adaptive evolution can occur through genetic mutations in DNA sequence, but it is unclear whether adaptive evolution can occur through analogous epigenetic mechanisms, such as through DNA methylation. If epigenetic variation contributes directly to evolution, species under threat of disease, invasive competition, climate change or other stresses would have greater stores of variation from which to draw. We looked for evidence of natural selection acting on variably methylated DNA sites using population genomic analysis across three climatologically distinct populations of valley oaks. We found patterns of genetic and epigenetic differentiations that indicate local adaptation is operating on large portions of the oak genome. While CHG methyl polymorphisms are not playing a significant role and would make poor targets for natural selection, our findings suggest that CpG methyl polymorphisms as a whole are involved in local adaptation, either directly or through linkage to regions under selection.","Alexander Platt,Alexander Platt,Paul F.

10.1016/s0378-1127(01)00645-4,,,Chloroplast DNA variation in European white oaks phylogeography and patterns of diversity based on data from over 2600 populations,"A consortium of 16 laboratories have studied chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in European white oaks. A common strategy for molecular screening, based on restriction analysis of four PCR-amplified cpDNA fragments, was used to allow comparison among the different laboratories. A total of 2613 oak populations (12,214 individual trees from eight species) were sampled from 37 countries, and analysed with the four fragments. They belong to eight related oak species: Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. frainetto, Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica, Q. canariensis and Q. macranthera. During this survey, 45 chloroplast variants were detected and are described together with their phylogenetic relationships, but several of these haplotypes were pooled when there were some risks of confusion across laboratories during the survey, and finally 32 remained that were mapped and used in diversity analyses. A strong phylogeographic structure is apparent from the data, where related haplotypes have broadly similar geographic distributions. In total, six cpDNA lineages are identified, which have distinct geographic distributions, mainly along a longitudinal gradient. Most haplotypes found in northern Europe are also present in the south, whereas the converse is not true, suggesting that the majority of mutations observed were generated prior to postglacial recolonisation, corroborating the conclusions of earlier studies. The description of a new western European lineage constitutes a major finding, compared to earlier phylogenetic treatments. Although the eight oak species studied systematically share cpDNA variants when in sympatry, they partition cpDNA diversity differently, as a consequence of their different ecology and life history attributes. Regional differences in levels of differentiation also exist (either species-specific or general); these seem to be related to the intensity of past and present management of the forests across Europe but also to the level of fragmentation of the range within these regions.","Rémy J.

10.1038/s41437-019-0258-3,31431738,,Wind pollination over 70 years reduces the negative genetic effects of severe forest fragmentation in the tropical oak Quercus bambusifolia.,"Whether wind pollination in trees can offset the negative genetic consequences of anthropogenic forest fragmentation is not clearly established. To answer this question, we examined the demographic genetics of Quercus bambusifolia over a 70-year recovery period in highly fragmented forests in Hong Kong. We sampled 1138 individuals from 37 locations, and genetically analysed the chronosequence through the classification of tree diameters from the same populations using 13 microsatellite markers. Our study reveals that severe fragmentation caused a significant genetic bottleneck with very few remaining but genetically diverse individuals. We observed an enhanced genetic diversity during demographic recovery. We found full-sibs within populations and half-sibs across the study range. This reflects a limited seed dispersal and extensive pollen flow. Despite reduced genetic structure both among and within populations, overall a strong persisting genetic differentiation (F′ST=0.240, P<0.01) and significant small-scale spatial genetic structure (F(1)=0.13, Sp=0.024, P<0.01) were observed. Existing bottlenecks and low effective population sizes within the temporal chronosequence suggest that the long-term effect of severe fragmentation cannot be entirely eliminated by wind pollination with demographic recovery in the absence of effective seed dispersal. Our results lead to recommendations for forest management.","Xueqin Zeng,Xueqin Zeng,Gunter A. Fischer,Gunter A Fischer,Gunter A. Fischer,Gunter A. Fischer",Heredity,2020

We first identified hybrids by means of microsatellite genotyping and assignment tests. Hybrids were rare, both among adults (4 of 190, 2.1%) and among acorns collected from Q. lobata trees (6 of 392, 1.5%). These low rates of hybridization at both early and late life history stages suggest that fertility barriers, rather than natural selection against hybrids, limit hybridization between these two species. However, hybrid adults, although rare, may facilitate gene flow between the two species. Acorns collected from a hybrid tree had both Q. lobata pollen donors (11 of 30, 37%) and Q. douglasii or hybrid pollen donors (19 of 30, 63%).

10.3732/ajb.89.11.1792,21665607,,Limited hybridization between Quercus lobata and Quercus douglasii (Fagaceae) in a mixed stand in central coastal California.,"Many oak species are interfertile, and morphological and genetic evidence for hybridization is widespread. Here we use DNA microsatellite markers to characterize hybridization between two closely related oak species in a mixed stand in central coastal California, Quercus lobata (valley oak) and Q. douglasii (blue oak) (Fagaceae). Genotypes from four microsatellite loci indicate that many alleles are shared between the two species. However, each species harbors unique alleles, and allele frequencies differ significantly. A Bayesian analysis of genetic structure in the stand identified two highly differentiated genetic clusters, essentially corresponding to species assignment based on morphology. Data from the four loci were sufficient to assign all 135 trees to one of the two species. In addition, five putative hybrid individuals having intermediate morphologies could be assigned genetically to one or the other species, and all but one had low probability of hybrid ancestry. Overally, only six (4.6%) trees showed .0.05 probability of hybrid ancestry, in all cases their probabilities for nonhybrid ancestry were substantially higher. We conclude that adult hybrids of Q. douglasii 3 Q. lobata are rare at this site and plasticity in morphological characters may lead to overestimates of hybridization among Quercus species.","Kathleen J.

Urban and agricultural development affects a significant fraction of the species’ range and predicted climate change is likely to dislocate many current populations. Here, we explore spatial patterns of multivariate genotypes and genetic diversity throughout the range of valley oak to determine whether ongoing and future patterns of habitat loss could threaten the evolutionary potential of the species by eradicating populations of distinctive genetic composition. This manuscript will address three specific questions: (i) What is the spatial genetic structure of the chloroplast and nuclear genetic markers? (ii) What are the geographical trends in the distribution of chloroplast and nuclear genotypes? (iii) Is there any part of the species’ range where allelic diversity in either the chloroplast or nuclear genomes is particularly high? We analysed six chloroplast and seven nuclear microsatellite genetic markers of individuals widespread across the valley oak range. We then used a multivariate approach correlating genetic markers and geographical variables through a canonical trend surface analysis, followed by GIS mapping of the significant axes. We visualized population allelic richness spatially with GIS tools to identify regions of high diversity. Our findings, based on the distribution of multivariate genotypes and allelic richness, identify areas with distinctive histories and genetic composition that should be given priority in reserve network design, especially because these areas also overlap with landscape change and little degree of protection. Thus, without a careful preservation plan, valuable evolutionary information will be lost for valley oak.","Delphine Grivet,Delphine Grivet,Victoria L. Sork,Victoria L. Sork,Robert D.

In this paper we focus on short distance dispersal (SDD) of pollen in a low-density stand of a savannah oak, Quercus lobata Nee. Specifically, we are interested in the proportional contributions of pollen donors, the pollen dispersal kernel that describes local matings, the extent to which wind influences mating success, and the extent to which pollen sources vary within the large canopy of these trees. Using maximum likelihood paternity analysis, we assigned sires for 474 outcrossed progeny of five seed trees, representing 120 of 160 potential mating pairs within a 250 m radius of each focal tree (ca. 20 ha plots). We first established that the effective number of pollen donors for progeny with sires within the plot was about 10 individuals, with average weighted pollination distances of 114.1 m. We estimated 18.5% pollen immigration into the 20 ha plots. We next established that the SDD portion of the dispersal kernel is best described by the exponential power, inverse power, and Weibull functions, all that capture high local dispersal with steep decay. Two of these models suggest that long distance dispersal is abundant, represented by a fat tail, while the Weibull indicates depauperate long distance dispersal, represented by a thin tail. The addition of a directional component corresponding to the predominant wind axis had no meaningful impact on these models. Finally, we established that different parts of an individual tree canopy of Q. lobata sample from the same homogeneous pollen pool showing no bias towards pollen sources near that part of the canopy. Overall findings suggest low-density Q. lobata populations show steep decay of SDD. Policies and ordinances governing the amount of allowable tree removal of savannah oak populations should recommend the preservation of local clusters of adults, as well as some connectivity among clusters.","Andrea R.

,,,"Genetic differentiation of two california red oak species, Quercus parvula var. shreveii and Q. wislizeni, based on AFLP genetic markers","Oaks are renowned for posing problems in defining species boundaries. One example is the case of the interior live oak complex that is usually taken to include two varieties of Quercus wislizeni from the Coast Ranges of California and the Sierra Nevada, and Q. parvula var. shreveii from the central coast of California. The latter taxon was separated from Q. wislizeni, and was recognized in The Jepson Manual, but still is not fully accepted, since its morphological separation is ambiguous. In an attempt to test differentiation of these two taxa, molecular genetic analysis was carried out using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 202 individuals from 19 populations including Q. parvula var. shreveii, Quercus wislizeni, Q. kelloggii and Q. agrifolia were analyzed. Four primer sets generated 311 polymorphic band classes. Although species-specific markers were observed between Q. kelloggii and other members of the red oak group in California, fixed genetic differences were not apparent among Q. agrifolia, Q. parvula var. shreveii and Q. wislizeni. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis revealed low levels of genetic differentiation among coast live oak, interior live oak and shreve oak. Cluster analysis also suggested that Q. agrifolia populations are more similar to populations of Q. parvula var. shreveii than to coastal populations of Q. wislizeni. This may reflect the relatively short time since divergence of these species. On the other hand, repetitive hybridization and introgression may have acted as a homogenizing factor for these genetic markers. The relatively high genetic similarity between Q. agrifolia and Q. parvula var. shreveii may have implications for the management of Sudden Oak Death in the limited range of the latter taxon.","Nasser Kashani,Nasser Kashani,Richard S.

10.1007/s11295-016-0975-1,,,Association of transcriptome-wide sequence variation with climate gradients in valley oak ( Quercus lobata ),"A fundamental goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how environment shapes genetic variation through its effect on demographic processes and through natural selection. In non-model species, transcriptome sequencing generates large single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels to disentangle these influences. Quercus lobata (valley oak) offers an excellent system for such analyses because it has stably occupied a climatically heterogeneous landscape throughout California. We used 220,427 diallelic SNPs from 22 individuals identified against a recently assembled reference transcriptome to (1) quantify transcriptome-wide associations of SNPs with climate indicative of demographic responses to climate, (2) identify SNPs especially associated with climate and thus potential targets of natural selection, and (3) test the hypothesis that genetic diversity is high in climate-adaptive candidate genes. Constrained ordinations (redundancy analysis) and variance partitioning showed that genetic structure in Q. lobata was explained by spatial location (49%) and climate (24%), especially minimum temperature and summer/spring precipitation balance, suggesting that climate influences neutral demographic processes and gene flow. After accounting for underlying structure, individual-based environmental association analyses identified 79 SNPs from 49 transcripts as candidates under natural selection by climate. These candidate genes had significantly higher SNP rates per base pair per locus (θ
                        W), nucleotide diversity (π), and gene diversity (G) than non-candidate genes. These results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that balancing selection maintains diversity in climate-adaptive genes. Climate has likely shaped both population demography and local adaptation in valley oak.","Paul F. Gugger,Paul F. Gugger,Shawn J. Cokus,Shawn J. Cokus,Victoria L. Sork,Victoria L.

We examine the movement of acorns from valley oak (Quercus lobata) trees to granaries maintained by acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) in two California oak savanna-woodlands differing in the distribution of Q. lobata within each site. In 2004, we sampled Q. lobata acorns from 16 granaries at Sedgwick Reserve in Santa Barbara County and 18 granaries at Hastings Reserve in Monterey County. Sedgwick has lower site-wide density of Q. lobata than Hastings as well as different frequencies of other Quercus species common to both sites. We found acorn woodpeckers foraged from fewer Q. lobata seed source trees (K g = 4.1 ± 0.5) at Sedgwick than at Hastings (K g = 7.6 ± 0.6) and from fewer effective seed sources (N em* = 2.00 and 5.78, respectively). The differences between sites are due to a greater number of incidental seed sources used per granary at Hastings than at Sedgwick. We also found very low levels of seed source sharing between adjacent granaries, indicating that territoriality is strong at both sites and that each social group forages on its own subset of trees. We discovered an interesting spatial pattern in the location of granaries. At Sedgwick, acorn woodpeckers situated their granaries within areas of higher-than-average tree density, while at Hastings, they placed them within areas of lower-than-average tree density, with the outcome that granaries at the two sites were located in areas of similar valley oak density. Our results illustrate that landscape characteristics might influence the number of trees visited by acorn woodpeckers and the locations of territories, while woodpecker social behavior, such as territoriality, shapes which trees are visited and whether they are shared with other social groups.","Douglas G.

10.1007/s10682-015-9769-4,,,Impact of asymmetric male and female gamete dispersal on allelic diversity and spatial genetic structure in valley oak (Quercus lobata Née),"The distribution and abundance of genetic diversity in plant populations is initiated by sexually asymmetric propagule dispersal through pollen and seeds. Because these processes occur serially, it is not transparent how each contributes to subsequent patterns of genetic diversity. Using combined seedling/seed coat assay for naturally distributed seedlings of Quercus lobata Nee, we extracted male and female gametic genotypes, and then assessed (wind-vectored) paternal and (gravity- and animal-vectored) maternal contributions to spatially distributed allelic diversity. We evaluated 200 naturally recruited seedlings from 4 open patches away from any adult canopies (denoted ‘open’), and 174 seedlings from 14 patches immediately beneath adult canopies (denoted ‘canopy’). The open patches included 19 % long distant dispersal events of >1 km while the canopy patches contained seedlings from one tree overhead. For each patch type, we partitioned average allelic diversity for six microsatellite loci for the whole study site (γ) into separate within-patch (α) and among-patch (β) components, translated into among-patch divergence (δ). We found that α-diversity resulting from seed dispersal was much less than that from pollen dispersal in both patch types, while total γ-diversity across the site was similar. Divergence (δ) among canopy patches was significantly greater than δ among open patches. We then evaluated spatial genetic autocorrelation (kinship) patterns for both open and canopy strata, separately for male and female gametes. Female gametes showed sharply declining kinship with increasing distance for canopy patches and modestly for open patches. In sharp contrast, male gametes from both patches showed only subtle decline of kinship, but seedlings still showed significant structure across patch types. On balance, sexual asymmetry in propagule dispersal shapes both the abundance and distribution of allelic diversity, with pollen dispersal promoting overall diversity but reducing spatial structure, but seed-dispersal reduces overall diversity and markedly increases spatial genetic structure.","Victoria L.

To predict the risks of spread of this disease, an understanding of the relationships among California's red oak species and of their population genetic structure is needed. We focus here on relationships among the four species of red oak. Whereas morphological distinction of Quercus wislizeni and Quercus parvula can pose problems, Quercus kelloggii and Quercus agrifolia in pure forms are easily distinguishable from one another and from Q. wislizeni and Q. parvula in the field. However, hybrids among all species combinations are known to occur in nature and these can confound data from ecological studies. Our results revealed greatest differentiation of the deciduous Q. kelloggii, with only weak AFLP fragment differentiation of the three remaining evergreen species. The molecular data suggest a closer affinity of Q. agrifolia with Q. wislizeni and Q. parvula contrary to earlier suggestions that its origins are likely to have been with northern deciduous oaks probably through a common ancestor with Q. kelloggii. Interior and coastal populations of Q. wislizeni separated in dendrograms based on phenetic and genetic distances suggesting probable isolation in different glacial refugia. The position of Q. parvula remains ambiguous, having a closer affinity with interior populations of Q. wislizeni and with Q. agrifolia, than with coastal populations of Q. wislizeni. Mean population differentiation in Q. wislizeni was 0.18, which is somewhat higher than the average for other oak species, suggesting that range fragmentation has occurred in the past, resulting in a metapopulation structure. Our results provide evidence that introgression among these species may be causing reticulation, further confounding species separation. Whereas Phytopthora has been reported on Q. agrifolia, Q. parvula and Q. kelloggii, it has not yet been detected in natural populations of Q. wislizeni. The species relationships that our molecular data show suggest that this is more likely a result of escape due to ecological tolerances than to genetic differences.","Richard S. Dodd,Richard S.

,,,"POPULATION STRUCTURE AND GENETIC VARIATION OF ISLAND OAK, QUERCUS TOMENTELLA ENGELMANN ON SANTA CATALINA ISLAND","The island oak, Quercus tomentella Engelmann, is an island endemic, found only on the California Channel Islands and Guadalupe Island, Mexico. It is among the rarest oaks and represents a distinct component of California Island biodiversity. Despite its important role in island ecosystems and its conservation vulnerability, few studies have addressed its evolution and conservation status. Here we report a population genetic study of Q. tomentella on Santa Catalina Island. This is the first application of DNA microsatellite markers for a species belonging to the oak section Protobalanus, and we show that microsatellite loci developed for American, European, and Asian white oaks amplify successfully in a member of Protobalanus. Genotypes of eight microsatellite loci were used to examine levels of genetic variation in 68 samples of Santa Catalina Q. tomentella, and we assess how existing variation is structured among different groves on Santa Catalina. Levels of genetic variation are quite high, with gene diversity estimates ranging from 0.658 to 0.909 and five to 19 alleles per locus. The variation, however, is not distributed evenly on Santa Catalina, with some stands harboring much more genetic diversity than others. We found evidence for predominantly clonal reproduction in two groves. Fourteen trees sampled at one of these sites had only two genotypes. In contrast, trees sampled from other groves were genetically distinct and thus likely recruited from acorns. The genetic data from this study can assist restoration efforts by identifying genetically diverse seed sources, and conversely, areas where genetic supplementation might be beneficial.","Mary V.
