The low genetic diversity of such edge populations is predicted to have resulted from genetic drift and reduced gene flow when compared to core populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of genetic diversity of marginal-edge populations of Quercus gilva, restricted to a few habitats on Jeju Island, and compared them with the southern Kyushu populations. We also evaluated their evolutionary potential and conservation value. The genetic diversity and structure were analyzed using 40 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed in this study. Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) has been employed to develop our insights, which can be inferred from historical distribution changes. Contrary to our expectations, we detected a similar level of genetic diversity in the Jeju populations, comparable to that of the southern Kyushu populations, which have been regarded as long-term glacial refugia with a high genetic variability of East Asian evergreen trees. We found no signatures of recent bottlenecks in the Jeju populations. The results of STRUCTURE, neighbor-joining phylogeny, and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with a significant barrier clearly demonstrated that the Jeju and Kyushu regions are genetically distinct. However, ENM showed that the probability value for the distribution of the trees on Jeju Island during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) converge was zero. In consideration of these results, we hypothesize that independent massive postglacial colonization from a separate large genetic source, other than Kyushu, could have led to the current genetic diversity of Jeju Island. Therefore, we suggest that the Jeju populations deserve to be separately managed and designated as a level of management unit (MU). These findings improve our understanding of the paleovegetation of East Asian evergreen forests, and the microevolution of oaks.",2020-10,31/05/24 4:29,31/05/24 4:30,31/05/24 4:29,1114,,10,11,,,A Disjunctive Marginal Edge of Evergreen Broad-Leaved Oak (Quercus gilva) in East Asia,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 10 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/2XYK94IL/Han et al. - 2020 - A Disjunctive Marginal Edge of Evergreen Broad-Lea.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Han-et-al-2020-1dc3ea368fe7469da6c4bf1b0aaec788,notion,<i>Quercus gilva</i>; conservation; genetic diversity; Jeju Island; marginal edge; massive colonization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23–33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics, we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides, constituting 27,727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs, with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates, which overlapped by only 43–64% in locus coverage. 17% (4,715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size, but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci—due, for example, to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting—are masked by the globally optimal tree. We find no evidence for strongly-supported alternative topologies in our study, suggesting that the phylogeny we recover is a robust estimate of large-scale phylogenetic patterns in the American oak clade. Our study is one of the first to demonstrate the utility of RAD-Seq data for inferring phylogeny in a 23–33 million year-old clade.",04/04/14,31/05/24 0:42,31/05/24 0:42,31/05/24 0:42,e93975,,4,9,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/WBTRJYAX/Hipp et al. - 2014 - A Framework Phylogeny of the American Oak Clade Ba.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Hipp-et-al-2014-651ef34604904df1b043d9db0b8553d1,notion,Amplified fragment length polymorphism; BLAST algorithm; Gene ontologies; Genetic loci; Nucleotides; Oaks; Phylogenetic analysis; Phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present phylogenomic analyses of a ca 30 Myr clade that strongly support morphologically defined species and the resolution of novel clades of white oaks; however, historical hybridization across clade boundaries is detectable and, undiagnosed, would obscure the imprint of biogeographic history in the phylogeny. Phylogenetic estimation from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing data for 156 individuals representing 81 species supports two successive intercontinental disjunctions of white oaks: an early vicariance between the Eurasian and American white oaks, and a second, independent radiation represented by two relictual species. A suite of subsampled and partitioned analyses, however, supports a more recent divergence of the Eurasian white oaks from within the American white oaks and suggests that historic introgression between the Eurasian white oaks and a now-relictual lineage biases concatenated phylogenetic estimates.

In this study, we utilized restrictionsite-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to develop an economical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA barcoding system that suffices to distinguish eight common, sympatric eastern North American white oak species. Two de novo clustering pipelines, PyRAD and Stacks, were used in combination with postclustering bioinformatic tools to generate a list of 291 potential SNPs, 80 of which were included in a barcoding toolkit that is easily implemented using MassARRAY mass spectrometry technology. As a proof-of-concept, we used the genotyping toolkit to infer potential hybridization between North American white oaks transplanted outside of their native range (Q. michauxii, Q. montana, Q muehlenbergii/Q. prinoides, and Q. stellata) into a horticultural collection surrounded by natural forests of locally native trees (Q. alba and Q. macrocarpa) in the living collection at The Morton Arboretum (Lisle, IL, USA). Phylogenetic and clustering analyses suggested low rates of hybridization between cultivated and native species, with the exception of one Q. michauxii mother tree, the acorns of which exhibited high admixture from either Q. alba or Q. stellata and Q. macrocarpa, and a hybrid between Q. stellata that appears to have backcrossed almost exclusively to Q. alba.

At the tips of the oak plastome phylogeny, recent gene migration and reticulation generally cause topology to reflect geographic structure, while deeper branches reflect lineage divergence. In this study, we quantify the simple and partial effects of geographic proximity and nucleome-inferred phylogenetic history on oak plastome phylogeny at different evolutionary scales. Our study compares pairwise phylogenetic distances based on complete plastome sequences, pairwise phylogenetic distances from nuclear restriction site-associated DNA sequences (RADseq), and pairwise geographic distances for 34 individuals of the white oak clade representing 24 North American and Eurasian species. Within the North American white oak clade alone, phylogenetic history has essentially no effect on plastome variation, while geography explains 11%–21% of plastome phylogenetic variance. However, across multiple continents and clades, phylogeny predicts 30%–41% of plastome variation, geography 3%–41%. Tipwise attenuation of phylogenetic informativeness in the plastome means that in practical terms, plastome data has little use in solving phylogenetic questions, but can still be a useful barcoding or phylogenetic marker for resolving questions among major clades.",01/09/17,30/05/24 23:37,30/05/24 23:37,30/05/24 23:37,720-732,,,60,,,A time and a place for everything,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Canadian Science Publishing,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/9MLQ8R3E/Andrew L.

They hybridize occasionally, but the complete replacement of Q. suber chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) by that of Q. ilex was identified in two specific geographical areas. The objective of this study was to determine whether the contrasting situation reflected current or recent geographical interspecies gene flow variation or was the result of ancient introgression.cpDNA PCR-RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) and variation at ten nuclear microsatellite loci were analysed in populations of each species, in 16 morphologically intermediate individuals and the progeny of several of them. Interspecies nuclear introgression was based on individual admixture rates using a Bayesian approach with no a priori species assignment, and on a maximum-likelihood (ML) method, using allele frequencies in the allopatric populations of each species as controls. Gene flow was compared specifically between populations located within and outside the specific areas.High interspecies nuclear genetic differentiation was observed, with twice the number of alleles in Q. ilex than in Q. suber. According to Bayesian assignment, approx. 1 % of individuals had a high probability of being F1 hybrids, and bidirectional nuclear introgression affected approx. 4 % of individuals in each species. Hybrid and introgressed individuals were identified predominantly in mixed stands and may have a recent origin. Higher proportions including allospecific genes recovered from past hybridization were obtained using the ML method. Similar rates of hybridization and of nuclear introgression, partially independent of cpDNA interspecies transfer suggestive of gene filtering, were obtained in the populations located within and outside the areas of complete cpDNA replacement.The results did not provide evidence for geographical variation in interspecies gene flow. In contrast, historical introgression is supported by palynological records and constitutes the more reliable origin of cpDNA replacement in specific regions.",01/09/09,30/05/24 1:44,30/05/24 1:44,30/05/24 1:44,725-736,,4,104,,Annals of Botany,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/D6HWQFG4/Lumaret y Jabbour-Zahab - 2009 - Ancient and current gene flow between two distantl.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/JPHL78WM/153088.html,notion://www.notion.so/Lumaret-Jabbour-Zahab-2009-e94a9d14a95a47f291535f618242d5de,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate the diversity and population structure of Persian oak in the western forests of Iran using morphological features. A total of 187 samples were collected from 15 locations in the Ilam province. Twenty phenotypic traits related to leaf, seed, and trunk characteristics were evaluated. Several multivariate statistical analyses were performed. The results revealed significant morphological diversity among the Persian oak ecotypes. Correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between leaf length attribute and distance from leaf base to maximum leaf width (0.55) and maximum width of the leaflet (0.64) traits. The leaf width at 50% attribute with the maximum width of the leaflet and distance from leaf base to maximum leaf width have a positive (0.8 and 0.51 respectively) and significant correlation (p≤0.05). According to principal component analysis, the components of leaf and seed traits have the most impact on morphological variance.

Thus, their genetic composition could be shaped by climatic drivers that differ from those occurring at higher latitudes, resulting in potentially adaptive variants of conservation value. Such variants could facilitate the adaptation of populations from other portions of the geographical range to similar future conditions anticipated under ongoing climate change. However, very few studies have assessed standing genetic variation at potentially adaptive loci in natural LLM populations. We investigated standing genetic variation at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 117 candidate genes and its links to putative climatic selection pressures across 19 pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) populations distributed along a regional climatic gradient near the species' southern range margin in southeastern Europe. These populations are restricted to floodplain forests along large lowland rivers, whose hydric regime is undergoing significant shifts under modern rapid climate change. The populations showed very weak geographical structure, suggesting extensive genetic connectivity and gene flow or shared ancestry. We identified eight (6.2%) positive FST-outlier loci, and genotype–environment association analyses revealed consistent associations between SNP allele frequencies and several climatic variables linked to water availability. A total of 61 associations involving 37 SNPs (28.5%) from 35 annotated genes provided important insights into putative functional mechanisms in our system.

While seed production is often used as a proxy for overall reproductive success, high mortality of seeds and the potential for trade-offs between seed number and quality draw this assumption into question. Parentage analyses of established seedlings can bring us one step closer to understanding the causes and consequences of variation in reproductive success. In this paper we demonstrate a new method for estimating individual seedling production and average percentage germination, using data from two mixed-species populations of red oaks (Quercus rubra, Q. velutina, Q. falcata, and Q. coccinea). We use these estimates to examine the distribution of female reproductive success and to test the relationship between seedling number and individual seed production, age, and growth rate. We show that both seed and seedling production are highly skewed, roughly conforming to zero-inflated lognormal distributions, rather than to the Poisson or negative-binomial distributions often assumed by population genetics analyses. While the number of established offspring is positively associated with mean annual seed production, a lower proportion of seeds from highly fecund individuals become seedlings. Our red oak populations also show evidence of trade-offs between growth rate and reproductive success. The high degree of inequality in seedling production shown here for red oaks, and by previous studies in other species, suggests that many trees may be more vulnerable to genetic drift than previously thought, if immigration in limited by fragmentation or other environmental changes.",2012,31/05/24 1:33,31/05/24 1:33,31/05/24 1:33,1082-1094,,5,93,,,Causes and consequences of unequal seedling production in forest trees,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,Publisher: Ecological Society of America,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/SXD5LYWP/Moran y Clark - 2012 - Causes and consequences of unequal seedling produc.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Moran-Clark-2012-e751b66604cf415e92e5548abf5ed963,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 11 haplotypes were found in 290 individuals from 20 populations, ten of which differed from the haplotypes of the main range. The results show a pronounced structure of the geographical distribution of haplotypes in roburoid oaks in the Crimea and the Caucasus, and the chloroplast haplotypes of the region belong to several divergent phylogenetic lineages. A comparison with data from other studies was carried out, with an assessment of the degree of effectiveness of using various chloroplast fragments and markers. The isolated phylogenetic position of the haplotypes from the Crimean-Caucasian populations and deep differences from the haplotypes of the main area allow us to conclude that roburoid oaks have historically been isolated for a long time in the Caucasus and Crimea. At the same time, the presence of common haplotypes indicates closer historical ties between the Crimean-Caucasian populations with Asia Minor and the Balkans. All haplotypes are identified by three fragments (ASq, CDq, and TFq), with a sufficient level of variability and suitable for solving problems of oak phylogeography in the Crimean-Caucasian region.

Restriction analysis and sequencing, as well as chloroplast DNA microsatellite loci (cpSSR), were used as genetic markers. For successful amplification and sequencing, new oak-specific primers were designed. For the first time for Q. robur, nucleotide sequences of three fragments (psaA-trnS, psbC-trnD, and trnT-trnF) were obtained with the determination of phylogenetic relationships among 13 identified haplotypes. In the eastern part of the range, several divergent chloroplast DNA lineages were identified. The haplotype groups were characterized by a nonrandom geographic distribution, which probably reflected the history of oak colonization in these regions. Sharp population differentiation in terms of haplotype composition and the level of variation was revealed. Specifically, in the eastern part of the Russian Plain and in the Urals, two haplotypes are widespread, which are disappearing in the west (Northwestern Russia, Belarus, Poland, and Western Ukraine), where nine haplotypes are found that are absent in east. Geographic structure of chloroplast DNA variation in pedunculate oak from Eastern Europe is similar to that in small-leaved lime (Semerikova et al., 2020), another representative of European temperate forests, in which, like in oak in this part of the range, sharp differences between western and eastern populations were observed. It seems likely that this is the result of postglacial colonization by both species from different, long isolated refugia, some of which were located in the east of the studied areas.

The other four haplotypes were rare, geographically restricted, and are probably derived from the two frequent haplotypes. Latitudinal or other clinal patterns in diversity levels or haplotype composition of populations were not apparent. The pattern of haplotype distribution was characterized by some mosaicism, with contrasting populations often situated in proximity. Average within-population diversity (hS = 0.299) and population differentiation (GST = 0.499) were, respectively, higher and lower than values reported in previous studies of oak species. There was evidence for phylogeographical structure, as indicated by NST (0.566) being significantly higher than GST.

A total of 12 haplotypes were detected, with one found in 75% of the trees. Population differentiation is relatively low (GST = 0.46), even when similarities between haplotypes are taken into account (NST = 0.50), pointing to a weak phylogeographical structure. Furthermore, no spatial structure of genetic diversity could be detected. The genetic differentiation increased northwards, reflecting the postglacial history of Q. rubra. The unusual aspect of this study was the low level of chloroplast DNA genetic differentiation in Q. rubra compared to that typically observed in other oak species. Palynological evidence indicates that during the last glacial maximum, Q. rubra had one major distribution range with populations located relatively far to the north, resulting in only modest movement northwards when climate improved, whereas European white oaks were largely restricted to the southern European peninsulas and experienced extensive movements during the postglacial period.

Therefore, Q. rubra was subject of many previous studies on its growth traits and attempts to infer the origin of various populations of this species using nuclear and chloroplast DNA markers. However, the exact geographic origin of German red oak stands has still not been identified. Its native range widely extends over North America, and the species can tolerate a broad range of environmental conditions.

In this study, we present two high-quality, chromosome-scale genome sequences for Quercus sichourensis (848.75 Mb) and Quercus rex (883.46 Mb). Comparative genomics analysis reveals that the difference in the number of plant disease resistance genes and the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution ratio (Ka/Ks) of protein-coding genes among Fagaceae species are related to different environmental adaptations. Interestingly, most genes related to starch synthesis in the investigated Quercoideae species are located on a single chromosome, as compared to the outgroup species, Fagus sylvatica. Furthermore, resequencing and population analysis of Q. sichourensis and Q. rex reveal that Q. sichourensis has lower genetic diversity and higher deleterious mutations compared to Q. rex.

This paper focuses on three emblematic and IUCN Red List threatened oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae), a highly speciose tree genus that contains numerous rare species and poses challenges for ex situ conservation. We compare the genetic diversity of three rare oak species—Quercus georgiana, Q. oglethorpensis, and Q. boyntonii—to common oaks; investigate the correlation of range size, population size, and the abiotic environment with genetic diversity within and among populations in situ; and test how well genetic diversity preserved in botanic gardens correlates with geographic range size. Our main findings are: (1) these three rare species generally have lower genetic diversity than more abundant oaks; (2) in some cases, small population size and geographic range correlate with genetic diversity and differentiation; and (3) genetic diversity currently protected in botanic gardens is inadequately predicted by geographic range size and number of samples preserved, suggesting non-random sampling of populations for conservation collections.

Quercus arbutifolia is a rare oak in MCFs of southern China and Vietnam. Its isolated populations, small population size and unique ecological niche make this species vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss. In this study, we used chloroplast (cpDNA) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences to investigate genetic divergence patterns and demographic history of five of the six known populations of Q. arbutifolia. Considering its small population size and fragmentation, Q. arbutifolia has unexpectedly high genetic diversity. The time since the most recent common ancestor of all cpDNA haplotypes was c. 10.25 Ma, and the rapid diversification of haplotypes occurred during the Quaternary. The maximum clade credibility chronogram of cpDNA haplotypes suggests that the DM population (Daming Mountain, Guangxi province) diverged early and rapidly became isolated from other populations. The Pearl River drainage system may have been the main geographic barrier between DM and other populations since the late Miocene. ITS data suggests that population expansion occurred during the last interglacial of the Quaternary. The combined effects of pre-Quaternary and Quaternary climatic and geological changes were the main drivers to the current genetic diversity and distribution pattern of Q. arbutifolia. Because of the high between-population genetic differentiation and high within-population genetic diversity of Q. arbutifolia, conservation efforts should be implemented for all populations, but if conservation resources are limited, populations DM, YZ (Mang Mountain, Hunan province) and ZZ (Daqin Mountain, Fujian province) should have priority.",30/08/16,29/05/24 9:55,29/05/24 9:56,29/05/24 9:55,90,,5,12,,Tree Genetics & Genomes,Conservation genetics of rare trees restricted to subtropical montane cloud forests in southern China,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/U9PF47GI/Xu et al. - 2016 - Conservation genetics of rare trees restricted to .pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Xu-et-al-2016-0bf1bca3b9284790ac13c6594b27f66f,notion,Population genetics; cpDNA; Endangered; ITS; Phylogeography; Quercus subgenus Cyclobalanopsis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this perspective, comparative phylogeographical analyses are useful in detecting common historical patterns by either comparing different species within the same area within a continent or by comparing similar species in different areas. Here, we analyse one taxon (the white oak, genus Quercus, subgenus Quercus, section Quercus) that is widespread worldwide, and we evaluate its phylogeographical pattern on two different continents: western North America and Western Europe. The goals of the present study are: (i) to compare the chloroplast genetic diversity found in one California oak species vs. that found in the extensively studied European oak species (in France and the Iberian Peninsula); (ii) to contrast the geographical structure of haplotypes between these two taxa and test for a phylogeographical structure for the California species. For this purpose, we used the same six maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and a similar sampling strategy. The haplotype diversity within site as well as the differentiation among sites was alike in both taxa, but the Californian species has higher allelic richness with a greater number of haplotypes (39 vs. 11 in the European white oak complex). Furthermore, in California these 39 haplotypes are distributed locally in patches while in the European oaks haplotypes are distributed into lineages partitioned longitudinally. These contrasted patterns could indicate that gene movement in California oak populations have been more stable in response to past climatic and geological events, in contrast to their European counterparts.",2006,30/05/24 4:43,30/05/24 4:43,30/05/24 4:43,4085-4093,,13,15,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03083.x,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/4X8YU46C/Grivet et al. - 2006 - Contrasting patterns of historical colonization in.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/9SECU3HF/j.1365-294x.2006.03083.html,notion://www.notion.so/Grivet-et-al-2006-9fff9539e8954458b8999ed7ddfb366d,notion,migration; chloroplast DNA; comparative phylogeography; glaciation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phylogeographic studies in this region are few in comparison with other regions and even less for tree species. The aim of the present study was to characterize the phylogeographic structure in 2 partially co-distributed endemic oak species (Quercus costaricensis and Q. bumelioides) of the Costa Rican mountains using chloroplast short sequence repeats (cpSSRs), and to test for the effect of geological and palaeoclimatic processes on their population history. Genetic diversity and structure, haplotype networks, patterns of seed-mediated gene flow and historical demography were estimated for both species. Results suggested contrasting patterns. Quercus costaricensis exhibited high values of genetic diversity, a marked phylogeographic structure, a north-to-south genetic diversity gradient and evidence of a demographic expansion during the Quaternary. Quercus bumelioides did not show significant genetic structure and the haplotype network and historical demography estimates suggested a recent population expansion probably during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The phylogeographic structure of Q. costaricensis seems to be related to Pleistocene altitudinal migration due to its higher altitudinal distribution. Meanwhile, historical seed-mediated gene flow through the lower altitudinal distribution of Q. bumelioides may have promoted the homogenization of genetic variation. Population expansion and stable availability of suitable climatic areas in both species probably indicate that palaeoclimatic changes promoted downwards altitudinal migration and formation of continuous forests allowing oak species to expand their distribution into the Panamanian mountains during glacial stages.",27/06/18,30/05/24 2:15,30/05/24 2:15,30/05/24 2:15,530-542,,5,109,,Journal of Heredity,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EMCX4ZPU/Rodríguez-Correa et al. - 2018 - Contrasting Patterns of Population History and See.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/HXSFNC8M/4917313.html,notion://www.notion.so/Rodr-guez-Correa-et-al-2018-ae63cc43f553464b99bf54447210c45e,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interspecific gene flow may play a key role in species adaptation to environmental change, as well as in the survival of endangered populations. Despite the fact that hybridization is quite common in plants, many hybridizing species, such as <italic>Quercus</italic> spp., maintain their integrity, while precise determination of genomic boundaries between species remains elusive. Novel high throughput sequencing techniques have opened up new perspectives in the comparative analysis of genomes and in the study of historical and current interspecific gene flow. In this work, we applied ddRADseq technique and developed an <italic>ad hoc</italic> bioinformatics pipeline for the study of ongoing hybridization between two relevant Mediterranean oaks, <italic>Q. ilex</italic> and <italic>Q. suber</italic>. We adopted a local scale approach, analyzing adult hybrids (<italic>sensu lato</italic>) identified in a mixed stand and their open-pollinated progenies. We have identified up to 9,251 markers across the genome and have estimated individual introgression levels in adults and seedlings. Estimated contribution of <italic>Q. suber</italic> to the genome is higher, on average, in hybrid progenies than in hybrid adults, suggesting preferential backcrossing with this parental species, maybe followed by selection during juvenile stages against individuals with higher <italic>Q. suber</italic> genomic contribution. Most discriminating markers seem to be scattered throughout the genome, suggesting that a large number of small genomic regions underlie boundaries between these species. In adult hybrids 273 markers (3%) showed allelic frequencies very similar to one of the parental species, and very different from the other; these loci could be relevant for understanding the hybridization process and the occurrence of adaptive introgression. Candidate marker databases developed in this study constitute a valuable resource to design large scale re-sequencing experiments in Mediterranean sclerophyllous oak species and could provide insight into species boundaries and adaptive introgression between <italic>Q. suber</italic> and <italic>Q. ilex</italic>.</p>",04/09/20,31/05/24 3:01,31/05/24 3:01,31/05/24 3:01,,,,11,,Front.

However, these formations are under increasing threat due to the lack of regeneration. We have analysed spatial genetic structure in a mixed parkland; inferences about gene dispersal have also been performed, according to the isolation by distance model. Noticeable differences have been detected between the species, despite their similar ecological roles. Restricted effective dispersal leads to kin structures in cork oak, up to 70 m, while no genetic structure is observed in holm oak. Our results suggest a very effective dispersal for the latter, with a local historical gene flow estimated between 55 and 95 m. This is the first time regeneration of Mediterranean oak parklands has been assessed from a genetic perspective. Effective gene flow detected for holm oaks allows us to discount the risk of inbreeding over successive generations. Thus, regeneration of Q. ilex dehesas will just require action directed to help the settlement of the saplings (such as limiting grazing). However, in those cases where densities are too low, more intense forestation (such as plantation and/or establishment of appropriate shelter) will be needed. The ‘density threshold’ for initiating regeneration will probably be higher for cork oak, due to its more limited dispersal and minor full-light tolerance.",2007-12,29/05/24 21:43,29/05/24 21:43,29/05/24 21:43,601-607,,6,99,,,Differences in fine-scale genetic structure and dispersal in Quercus ilex L. and Q. suber L.,,,,,,,en,2007 The Genetics Society,,,,www.nature.com,,Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TR9SV957/Soto et al. - 2007 - Differences in fine-scale genetic structure and di.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Soto-et-al-2007-2fe2b8c63cc4402dabe4166388ee2279,notion,Biomedicine; general; Human Genetics; Cytogenetics; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Plant Genetics and Genomics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to extensive hybridization and introgression, it is considered to be one of the most challenging plant taxa, both taxonomically and phylogenetically. Quercus aquifolioides is an evergreen sclerophyllous oak species that is endemic to, but widely distributed across, the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in the Eastern Himalayas. Here, we compared the fully assembled chloroplast (cp) genome of Q. aquifolioides with those of three closely related species. The analysis revealed a cp genome ranging in size from 160,415 to 161,304 bp and with a typical quadripartite structure, composed of two inverted repeats (IRs) separated by a small single copy (SSC) and a large single copy (LSC) region. The genome organization, gene number, gene order, and GC content of these four Quercus cp genomes are similar to those of many angiosperm cp genomes. We also analyzed the Q. aquifolioides repeats and microsatellites. Investigating the effects of selection events on shared protein-coding genes using the Ka/Ks ratio showed that significant positive selection had acted on the atpF gene of Q. aquifolioides compared to two deciduous oak species, and that there had been significant purifying selection on the atpF gene in the chloroplast of evergreen sclerophyllous oak trees. In addition, site-specific selection analysis identified positively selected sites in 12 genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on shared protein-coding genes from 14 species defined Q. aquifolioides as belonging to sect. Heterobalanus and being closely related to Q. rubra and Q. aliena.

This study explores the use of a recently developed focused ultrasound extraction (FUSE) technique to enable the rapid release of DNA from plant tissues for genetic analysis. Methods FUSE generates a dense acoustic cavitation bubble cloud that pulverizes targeted tissue into acellular debris. This technique was applied to leaf samples of American chestnut (Castanea dentata), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), and chestnut oak (Quercus montana). Results We observed that FUSE can extract high quantities of DNA in 9–15 min, compared to the 30 min required for control DNA extraction methods. FUSE extracted DNA quantities of 24.33 ± 6.51 ng/mg and 35.32 ± 9.21 ng/mg from American chestnut and red maple, respectively, while control methods yielded 6.22 ± 0.87 ng/mg and 11.51 ± 1.95 ng/mg, respectively. The quality of the DNA released by FUSE allowed for successful amplification and next-generation sequencing.

We studied valley oak (Quercus lobata), a threatened species of California (USA) savannas and oak woodlands, with a distribution forming a ring around the Central Valley grasslands. Our main goal was to determine the role of topography and land cover on patterns of gene flow and to test whether elevation or land cover forms stronger barriers to gene flow among valley oak populations. We sampled valley oaks in 12 populations across the range of this species, genotyped each tree at eight nuclear microsatellite loci, and created a series of resistance surfaces by assigning different resistance values to land cover type and elevation. We also estimated recent migration rates and evaluated them with regard to landscape features. There was a significant but weak relationship between Euclidian distance and genetic distance. There was no relationship between genetic distances and land cover, but a significant relationship between genetic distances and elevation resistance. We conclude that gene flow is restricted by high elevations in the northern part of the valley oak range and by high elevations and the Central Valley further south. Migration rate analysis indicated some gene flow occurring east–west but we suggest that the high connectivity in the northern Central Valley is facilitating the formation of these links.

Long-term logging and habitat destruction have resulted in population decline and distribution retreat of Q. tiaoloshanica. To determine the impact of logging on the genetic diversity of Q. tiaoloshanica, the authors investigated the genetic structures using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in four regenerated stands after logging and in one unlogged stand. Compared with the unlogged stand, the effective number of alleles per locus dropped by 1.0% in selective logging stands and by 2.0% in clear logging stands, corresponding to reductions of 3.8% and 5.2%, respectively, in mean Nei's gene diversity and 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in mean Shannon diversity index. No substantial genetic erosion was detected in any of the regenerated stands owing to the high tree density and high heterogeneity of the Q. tiaoloshanica stands investigated. Meanwhile, there was no natural regeneration of the species observed in a Dacrydium pierrei Hickel plantation 700 m away from the regenerated stands, suggesting the limited ability of seed dispersal of Q. tiaoloshanica. Clear logging should be undertaken cautiously because the total number of plant species dropped by 15.2% in the clear-logged stands compared with the unlogged stand. To conserve the genetic diversity of this species, as well as the plant biodiversity of tropical forests, the habitats of Q. tiaoloshanica should be protected against exploitation in terms of agricultural or other forms of land use, and some mature trees should be preserved as seed sources to maintain an adequate regeneration base for this species in the management of logging.

We focus here on Quercus afares, an endemic North African species that combines morphological, physiological and ecological traits of both Q. suber and Q. canariensis, two phylogenetically distant species. These two species are sympatric with Q. afares over most of its distribution. We studied two Q. afares populations (one from Algeria and one from Tunisia), as well as several populations of both Q. suber and Q. canariensis sampled both within and outside areas where these species overlap with Q. afares. A genetic analysis was conducted using both nuclear (allozymes) and chloroplastic markers, which shows that Q. afares originates from a Q. suber × Q. canariensis hybridisation. At most loci, Q. afares predominantly possesses alleles from Q. suber, suggesting that the initial cross between Q. suber and Q. canariensis was followed by backcrossing with Q. suber.

However, at higher latitudes where Qd is rare, a coastal Qc ecotype with Qd-like traits is distributed in the coastal areas. We distinguished inland Qc, coastal Qc, and coastal Qd populations based on genome-wide genotypes and multitrait phenotypes and verified introgression from coastal Qd to coastal Qc using reduced library sequencing.

However, poor quality and incomplete maturation of somatic embryos restrict any application. Given that epigenetic and hormonal control govern many developmental stages, including maturation of zygotic embryos, global DNA methylation and abscisic acid (ABA) were analyzed during development and maturation of cork oak somatic embryos. Our results indicated that development of somatic embryos concurred with a decrease in 5-mdC. In contrast, endogenous ABA content showed a transient increase with a peak in immature E2 embryos denoting the onset of the maturation phase. A cold stratification phase was necessary for embryos to acquire germination ability, which coincided with a significant decrease in 5-mdC and ABA content. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that there was a specific spatial-temporal regulation during embryogenesis, particularly after the cold treatment. The acquisition of germination capacity concurred with a general low 5-mdC signal in the root meristem, while retention of the 5-mdC signal was mainly located in the shoot meristem and provascular tissues. Conversely, ABA immunolocalization was mainly located in the root and shoot apical meristems. Furthermore, a strong decrease in the ABA signal was observed in the root cap after the stratification treatment suggesting a role for the root cap during development of somatic embryos.

However, dispersal can be challenging to quantify. Here, we present a Bayesian model that integrates genetic and ecological data to simultaneously estimate effective seed and pollen dispersal parameters and the parentage of sampled seedlings. This model is the first developed for monoecious plants that accounts for genotyping error and treats dispersal from within and beyond a plot in a fully consistent manner. The flexible Bayesian framework allows the incorporation of a variety of ecological variables, including individual variation in seed production, as well as multiple sources of uncertainty. We illustrate the method using data from a mixed population of red oak (Quercus rubra, Q. velutina, Q. falcata) in the NC piedmont. For simulated test data sets, the model successfully recovered the simulated dispersal parameters and pedigrees. Pollen dispersal in the example population was extensive, with an average father–mother distance of 178 m. Estimated seed dispersal distances at the piedmont site were substantially longer than previous estimates based on seed-trap data (average 128 m vs. 9.3 m), suggesting that, under some circumstances, oaks may be less dispersal-limited than is commonly thought, with a greater potential for range shifts in response to climate change.",2011,30/05/24 5:02,30/05/24 5:02,30/05/24 5:02,1248-1262,,6,20,,,Estimating seed and pollen movement in a monoecious plant,,,,,,,en,© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05019.x,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/V8MIGXAG/Moran y Clark - 2011 - Estimating seed and pollen movement in a monoeciou.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/8TA66LUC/j.1365-294x.2011.05019.html,notion://www.notion.so/Moran-Clark-2011-1cc0501855be4d6dad30a54eb25ff9c6,notion,Quercus; microsatellites; population ecology; hierarchical Bayesian models; parentage; seed dispersal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KEY RESULTS: We found that Q. pacifica is a genetically cohesive and differentiated evolutionary lineage, diverging from mainland scrub oaks in the Pleistocene with little subsequent introgression. Genetic differentiation of Q. pacifica among islands is small but significant. Both recent and historical gene flow were surprisingly high considering the disjunct distribution of Q. pacifica on islands separated by as much as 125 km of open ocean. Gene flow estimates were highest between the two northern islands and from the northern islands to Santa Catalina.

In this study, we integrated multilocus phylogeography, species distribution models (SDMs), and regression analysis to investigate the effects of paleoenvironmental changes on the contemporary genetic patterns of Quercus schottkyana, an endemic and dominant evergreen oak in the YPA. A total of 380 samples were taken from 29 populations, covering the natural geographical distribution of Q. schottkyana. Molecular dating indicated that haplotype divergence began at late Miocene; this finding supported the hypothesis that major uplifting of YPA occurred after late Miocene, which led to the speciation and divergence of Q. schottkyana. Unlike previous biome reconstruction studies based on palynology data, our SDM analysis indicated that the distribution ranges of Q. schottkyana was comparatively stable after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and experienced only a slight northward expansion afterward. Species genetic diversity showed a significant negative correlation to the habitat stability using regression analysis. These analyses suggested the admixture of individuals from genetically differentiated populations in the unstable habitats, which in turn increased the genetic diversity of Q. schottkyana. We also found that climate gradient along the latitude cline influenced the genetic structure of Q. schottkyana.

Because most phylogeographic studies have used neutral markers, the role of selection may have been undervalued. In this paper, we contend that plants provide a useful evolutionary lesson about the impact of selection on spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation, when the environment affects which individuals can colonize new sites, and on adaptive genetic variation, when environmental heterogeneity creates divergence at specific loci underlying local adaptation. Specifically, we discuss five characteristics found in plants that intensify the impact of selection: sessile growth form, high reproductive output, leptokurtic dispersal, isolation by environment, and the potential to evolve longevity. Collectively, these traits exacerbate the impact of environment on movement between populations and local selection pressures—both of which influence phylogeographic structure. We illustrate how these unique traits shape these processes with case studies of the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata, and the western North American lichen, Ramalina menziesii. Obviously, the lessons we learn from plant traits are not unique to plants, but they highlight the need for future animal, plant, and microbe studies to incorporate its impact. Modern tools that generate genome-wide sequence data are now allowing us to decipher how evolutionary processes affect the spatial distribution of different kinds of genes and also to better model future spatial distribution of species in response to climate change.",2016,30/05/24 0:37,30/05/24 0:37,30/05/24 0:37,8064-8071,,29,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,Publisher: National Academy of Sciences,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EQDJ5IXE/Sork et al. - 2016 - Evolutionary lessons from California plant phyloge.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Sork-et-al-2016-e5d2128a477f4f479aa89d430c0a4450,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the levels of quantitative genetic variation of populations of the tropical tree Quercus oleoides Cham. and Schlect. for a suite of traits related to resource use and drought resistance. We tested whether quantitative genetic variation differed across traits, populations and watering treatments. We also tested potential evolutionary factors that might have shaped such a pattern: selection by climate and genetic drift. We measured 15 functional traits on 1322 1-year-old seedlings of 84 maternal half-sib families originating from five populations growing under two watering treatments in a greenhouse. We estimated the additive genetic variance, coefficient of additive genetic variation and narrow-sense heritability for each combination of traits, populations and treatments. In addition, we genotyped a total of 119 individuals (with at least 20 individuals per population) using nuclear microsatellites to estimate genetic diversity and population genetic structure. Our results showed that gas exchange traits and growth exhibited strikingly high quantitative genetic variation compared with traits related to leaf morphology, anatomy and photochemistry. Quantitative genetic variation differed between populations even at geographical scales as small as a few kilometers. Climate was associated with quantitative genetic variation, but only weakly. Genetic structure and diversity in neutral markers did not relate to coefficient of additive genetic variation.

Even though pre- and post­zygotic isolation mechanisms have been described for interfer­tile oak species, natural hybridization is common in contact zones between related oaks. The apparent restriction of inter­specific hybrids between ecologically divergent species to intermediate environments in contact zones suggests postzy­gotic isolation via environmental selection against hybrids in parental environments. Overrepresentation of hybrids in seeds as compared to adult trees provides additional indirect evi­dence for selection against hybrids. Here, we used genetic assignment analyses in progeny obtained from a sympatric stand of Quercus rubra and Quercus ellipsoidalis, two interfertile species with different adaptations to drought, to characterize the number of hybrids and “pure” species in the non-germinated acorns and in seedlings. The occurrence of 43.6 % F1 hybrids and introgressive forms among the non-germinated acorns and their very low frequency in the seedlings (9.3 %) is to our knowledge the first direct evidence for early selection against hybrids in oaks possibly as result of genetic incompatibilities. Additionally, we found a signature of positive selection on EST-SSR PIE200 in Q. rubra which needs further confirmation.

Fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) investigations provide a way to examine the spatial arrangement of genetic variation within populations. SGS can result from restricted seed and pollen dispersal and might be affected by geographic isolation and environmental changes and disturbances even in outcrossing wind-pollinated species like oaks. Studying the SGS of peripheral populations provides information that can be used to develop improved conservation and management plans at the species’ range edge. We assessed the level of genetic variation and SGS in twelve range edge populations in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (USA): eight Quercus rubra and four Quercus ellipsoidalis populations that were subject to different management regimes and natural disturbances. In contrast to Q. rubra populations, the drought tolerant Q. ellipsoidalis populations are isolated from the species’ main distribution range. These populations are not actively managed but are  especially prone to recurring fire events. The four managed and four old growth (“unmanaged”) Q. rubra populations displayed similar levels of genetic variation. Likewise the Sp statistic showed similar SGS levels in managed and unmanaged Q. rubra populations (Sp = 0.005) comparable to other Quercus species (European Q. robur: Sp = 0.003). Q. ellipsoidalis populations showed similar or more pronounced SGS than neighboring Q. rubra populations extending up to 83 m in one population. A significant excess of homozygotes across markers in two of the Q. ellipsoidalis populations suggests potential inbreeding. In summary, diverse management activities combined with various natural disturbances are likely both influencing SGS patterns. Outcrossing forest trees like oaks hold large amounts of genetic diversity allowing adaptation to environmental changes over their long life spans. Reductions of these genetic stores, through inbreeding for example, can inhibit a species’ ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.",01/06/15,29/05/24 9:12,29/05/24 9:12,29/05/24 9:12,1601-1612,,6,301,,Plant Syst Evol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/5DAR6N3Y/Lind-Riehl y Gailing - 2015 - Fine-scale spatial genetic structure of two red oa.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Lind-Riehl-Gailing-2015-2cabb30de763483d8495694e4f204b0f,notion,Quercus; Autocorrelation analysis; Management; Silviculture; Sp statistic; Spatial genetic structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we introduce a draft genome assembly of valley oak (Quercus lobata) using Illumina sequencing of adult leaf tissue of a tree found in an accessible, well-studied, natural southern California population. Our assembly includes a nuclear genome and a complete chloroplast genome, along with annotation of encoded genes. The assembly contains 94,394 scaffolds, totaling 1.17 Gb with 18,512 scaffolds of length 2 kb or longer, with a total length of 1.15 Gb, and a N50 scaffold size of 278,077 kb. The k-mer histograms indicate an diploid genome size of ∼720–730 Mb, which is smaller than the total length due to high heterozygosity, estimated at 1.25%. A comparison with a recently published European oak (Q. robur) nuclear sequence indicates 93% similarity. The Q. lobata chloroplast genome has 99% identity with another North American oak, Q. rubra. Preliminary annotation yielded an estimate of 61,773 predicted protein-coding genes, of which 71% had similarity to known protein domains. We searched 956 Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs, and found 863 complete orthologs, of which 450 were present in > 1 copy.

Three cpDNA and one mtDNA primer pairs were used in the survey, each in combination with one restriction enzyme. Six haplotypes belonging to two very divergent lineages were detected; one lineage predominates in each species, and is probably ancestral, as inferred from comparisons with other oak species. In the mixed-species populations, cytoplasmic genomes were frequently shared across species, as indicated by an introgression ratio of 0.63. This index is a new measure of the propensity of species to share locally genetic markers, varying from zero (complete differentiation) to one (no differentiation). By contrast, more closely related deciduous oak species (Q. robur, Q. petraea and Q. pubescens) have introgression ratios varying from 0.82 to 0.97. The introgression events appear to have been more frequent in the direction Q. ilex (female) × Q. suber (male), a finding which seems attributable to the flowering phenology of these two species. This asymmetry may have favoured immigration of Q. suber beyond its main range, in regions already colonized by Q. ilex. There, rare hybridization and further introgression through long distance pollen flow have established populations that are morphologically indistinguishable from Q. suber but that have cytoplasmic genomes originating from the local Q. ilex populations.",2001,29/05/24 21:46,29/05/24 21:46,29/05/24 21:46,2003-2012,,8,10,,,Frequent cytoplasmic exchanges between oak species that are not closely related,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01330.x,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/C2D6ICUD/Belahbib et al. - 2001 - Frequent cytoplasmic exchanges between oak species.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/M6WU9E8A/j.0962-1083.2001.01330.html,notion://www.notion.so/Belahbib-et-al-2001-17fad14a782a42c59e590e5ae6369f8d,notion,hybridization; introgression; cpDNA; geographical structure; mtDNA; PCR–RFLP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine this question, we have characterized the spatial genetic structure of N = 191 Q. lobata individuals, spread over an area of 230 ha, using eight microsatellite loci. The observed autocorrelogram suggests an historical standard deviation of gene flow distance of about 350 m per generation, higher than contemporary pollen dispersal estimates.

Analyses utilized seven nuclear microsatellites that were genotyped from 330 individuals of 16 populations. Genetic diversity was highest for the Japanese Kyushu populations. The allelic diversity of populations was similar between Jeju Island and Kyushu, implying that they are putative refugia.

Results from Bayesian clustering and Monmonier’s algorithm indicated that populations are roughly partitioned from west (Korea and Kyushu) to east (Japanese Honshu). Therefore, the two divisions within this species are demographically independent and may have arisen due to past fragmentation. In considering the mixed genetic structure between Korea and Kyushu populations, and the higher levels of genetic diversity in mainland Korea relative to Honshu, we hypothesized that this species has been able to survive within Jeju Island and Kyushu.

To estimate the contribution of sessile oak Q. petraea to the genetic pool of Q. robur, six populations (109 trees) of Q. petraea were added to the analysis. Comparison was made with the previously obtained chloroplast DNA data. A low level of nuclear DNA introgression of Q. petraea in Q. robur was revealed. No significant influence of Q. petraea on the geographic structure of Q. robur diversity was found. High differentiation in nuclear markers between populations of Q. robur from different geographical regions and within the Caucasus was obtained. According to the results of the Bayesian clustering implemented with STRUCTURE program, the largest difference in Q. robur was observed between Caucasian populations and the populations of North Eastern Europe. This subdivision is quite consistent with the deep differences in chloroplast DNA between these regions, where no common or closely related chloroplast haplotypes have been found, and indicates an ancient age of the isolation of the Caucasus, estimated from microsatellite data using the ABC method as 3500 generations (~350 ka ago, Middle Pleistocene). In the north of Eastern Europe, according to STRUCTURE results, a weak trend from east to west was observed, in contrast to the chloroplast DNA data indicating a sharp difference between the populations of the east of the Russian Plain and Urals from the more western ones due to the absence of common haplotypes. The populations of the southeastern Balkans differed from the populations of North Eastern Europe, and the ABC estimate of divergence time (910 generations) significantly exceeded the age of the Last Glacial Maximum, which rejected the participation of southeastern region of the Balkans in the recolonization of Eastern Europe after the last glaciation. In the Caucasus, the structure of nuclear DNA generally corresponded to the phylogeography of chloroplast DNA and to the morphological data. Deep differentiation was found in nuclear DNA between western and eastern Caucasian populations, with an estimated age of divergence of 2100 generations. In the Crimea and the extreme Western Caucasus, STRUCTURE revealed a mixture of the Balkan and West Caucasian clusters, which, in combination with chloroplast DNA data, indicates their origin as a result of multiple migrations. This group of populations contains only West Caucasian and Crimean endemic chloroplast haplotypes, without the presence of Balkan haplotypes, which indicates the introgression of the genes of the Balkan cluster into the Crimean and West Caucasian populations through pollen flow, without seed transfer.

Most populations are secondary forests resulting from ecological succession. In this study, we estimated the genetic diversity and structure of natural populations of Q. variabilis.

Conservation of imperiled plant species can benefit from ex situ collections, including the living collections of botanic gardens and arboreta. Such living collections should strive to capture and maintain the genetic diversity found in the remaining wild populations. Ex situ collections may also harbor genetic variability that has been lost from wild populations. Quercus hinckleyi is an extremely rare (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources [IUCN] Critically Endangered) oak known from a few sites in Presidio County, Texas. It is the only native US oak protected under the Endangered Species Act. Here we evaluate the genetic variation of the Q. hinckleyi ex situ metacollection relative to that of the remnant in situ population. Methodology. We apply microsatellite genotyping to Q. hinckleyi sampled from plants growing in ex situ collections (N = 22 , from nine gardens) and compare the results with genetic studies of the in situ population. We compare allelic diversity, genotypic diversity, and population structure. Pivotal results. The ex situ metacollection is small but has high allelic diversity and captures about 57% of the allelic diversity of the wild population. Ex situ plants contain 22 new alleles that contribute 13% of the species' total allelic diversity. All ex situ individuals have unique genotypes, none of which were found in situ, and thus they comprise 15% of the species' genotypic variation. The ex situ plants align with only one of three genetic clusters identified in situ, demonstrating an important gap in the ex situ metacollection. Conclusions. The ex situ collection of Q. hinckleyi , while small, is genetically diverse and provides additional allelic and genotypic diversity not currently existing in situ. However, a significant portion of genetic diversity is lacking from ex situ plants, with the metacollection likely derived from only one of the in situ clusters.

Hence, they are likely to harbour rare genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions and therefore are of particular interest to understand climate adaptation. We examined genetic structure of nine northern marginal mainland, peninsular and isolated island natural populations of northern red oak (Quercus rubra), a valuable long-lived North American hardwood tree species, covering a wide climatic range using 17 nuclear microsatellites. We found pronounced genetic differentiation of a disjunct isolated island population from all mainland and peninsular populations. Furthermore, we observed remarkably strong fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) in all investigated populations. Such high SGS values are uncommon and were previously solely observed in extreme range-edge marginal oak populations in one other study. We found a significant correlation between major climate parameters and SGS formation in northern range-edge red oak populations, with more pronounced SGS in colder and drier regions. Most likely, the harsh environment in leading edge populations influences the density of reproducing trees within the populations and therefore leads to restricted overlapping of seed shadows when compared to more central populations. SGS was negatively correlated with effective population size and increased with latitude of the population locations. The significant positive association between genetic distances and precipitation differences between populations may be indicative of isolation by adaptation in the observed range-edge populations. However, this association was not confirmed by a multiple regression analysis including geographic distances and precipitation distances, simultaneously.

Although there is compelling evidence that seeds and seedlings die from conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) as predicted by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, characterising adult recruitment remains a challenge for long-living trees. Previous studies have used the decrease in fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) across life stages to indicate CNDD; however, this has not been tested rigorously. We addressed these challenges by integrating dispersal kernels and FSGS. To establish links between density dependence and FSGS, we simulated seedlings based on the estimated dispersal kernels from parentage analyses, and further simulated adults under various seedling-to-adult recruitment scenarios, using an individual-based spatially explicit model. We tested this method in an isolated Cyclobalanopsis glauca population on China's Dajinshan Island. We detected significant FSGS in the seedlings and weaker, though also significant, FSGS in the adults. As expected, the observed FSGS of seedlings was well predicted by the simulated seedlings, with observations falling inside the 95% confidence envelopes over all distance classes. However, the simulations showed that CNDD enhanced the FSGS while positive density dependence dampened it during the seedling-to-adult transition. The adult FSGS of our population was therefore explained by positive rather than negative density-dependent adult recruitment. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the change of FSGS in conjunction with dispersal-based model tests can offer a valuable insight into density-dependent adult recruitment. The results indicate that the transitions from seedlings to adults in C. glauca are dominantly regulated not by Janzen–Connell effects, but by processes of positive density dependence. More broadly, the findings may provide a caution against extrapolations of widespread Janzen–Connell effects in seeds and seedlings to adult recruits, underscoring a critical gap between mechanisms at early stages and long-term population and community dynamics.",2021,30/05/24 4:05,30/05/24 4:05,30/05/24 4:05,2317-2328,,6,109,,,Genetic tracking of density-dependent adult recruitment,,,,,,,en,© 2021 British Ecological Society,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2745.13639,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EBNSND7A/Tong et al. - 2021 - Genetic tracking of density-dependent adult recrui.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/GB352JWH/1365-2745.html,notion://www.notion.so/Tong-et-al-2021-02192d47c5db4743846e5bfeb00a6275,notion,adult recruitment; conspecific density dependence; Cyclobalanopsis glauca; effective dispersal kernel; Janzen–Connell hypothesis; plant population and community dynamics; spatial genetic structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How such contrasting geological-derived soils influence genetic diversity and structure of local plant populations have not been well documented, hindering our understanding of plant adaptive evolution in subtropical areas. In this study, we applied double digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to investigate the genetic variation and differentiation of natural Quercus variabilis populations growing at geologically derived soil P-rich and P-deficient sites in subtropical China. Results showed that Q. variabilis populations had lower genetic diversity at P-rich sites than those at P-deficient sites, and genetic diversity was negatively correlated only with soil P content (p < 0.05) across these sites. The genetic variation mainly occurred within populations (95.76%) with a much smaller amount among populations (2.27%) and between the two P-type sites (1.97%). Moreover, significant genetic divergence (p < 0.0001) occurred between the two site-type populations. Among genes embedded in the selective sweep areas in genome for populations at P-rich sites and P-deficient sites, some were annotated as transcription factors, and some were involved in protein synthesis and degradation, involved in regulatory responses to P availability and other environmental stresses. These results suggest that the availability of soil P could be a key selective force driving adaptive genetic differentiation among Q. variabilis populations across variable P content soils in subtropical areas.",09/06/21,29/05/24 9:18,29/05/24 9:19,29/05/24 9:18,44,,4,307,,Plant Syst Evol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/2TRETLZ4/Ji et al. - 2021 - Genetic variation and differentiation of Quercus v.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Ji-et-al-2021-95fbd4a979d84e0598973286bee28dfc,notion,Adaptation; DdRAD-seq; Genetic variation and differentiation; Phosphate rocks; Quercus variabilis; Soil P content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The community consists of five oak species: Q. robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and Q. frainetto - that are closely related -, and Q. cerris. A total of five chloroplast haplotypes was identified. Q. cerris was fixed for a single haplotype. The other four species shared the two most common haplotypes. One haplotype was confined to Q. robur and a very rare one was restricted to Q. petraea. Both types of nuclear markers revealed a larger genetic variation for Q. pubescens and Q. petraea than for Q. frainetto and Q. robur, although the differences between species are in most cases not significant. At the nuclear level, Q. cerris could be clearly separated from the other four oak species confirming the taxonomic classification. Regardless of the estimate used, the levels of polymorphism revealed by microsatellites were much higher than those based on isozymes. For the four closely related species the overall genetic differentiation was significant at both categories of nuclear markers. Several loci, such as Acp-C for isozymes, and ssrQpZAG36 and ssrQrZAG96 for microsatellites were very useful to discriminate among species. However, the level of differentiation varied markedly between pairs of species.

Gray), a shrub tree on the Pacific coast of Japan, were examined to elucidate historical population dynamics using five chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) marker regions and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. Three cpDNA haplotypes (A, B and C) were identified in a screen of 41 populations across the entire distribution range in Japan. Haplotype A was the most prevalent and was found in the entire range. Haplotype B was locally restricted to the Kii Peninsula, while haplotype C was restricted to the southwestern part of Japan. These haplotypes corresponded with the nuclear genetic constitution revealed by microsatellite markers. Two genetically differentiated major groups were identified by STRUCTURE analysis applied to 536 individuals from 28 populations, and they mostly corresponded with the two major cpDNA haplotypes, A and C. These populations were further divided into three geographically identified groups: group 1 in the area including Kanto and Tokai regions, the Kii Peninsula and the Muroto-misaki Cape on the Pacific coast; group 2 in the Bungo-suido Channel area; and group 3 in southern Kyushu and Okinawa. Populations in the Seto Inland Sea were divided into two groups: one was included in group 1 and appears to have originated from last glacial maximum (LGM) refugia located in the Kii Peninsula, while the other was included in group 2 and appears to have originated from LGM refugia located in southern Kyushu. These groups can be considered as conservation units for the preservation of unique seashore ecosystems, or as a seed source to foster coastal protection forests and next-generation production forests.

Here, we studied Quercus havardii Rydb., a uniquely adapted desert oak endemic to the Southwest region of the United States, using genetic, morphometric, and environmental datasets over various geographic scales to quantify differentiation and understand forces influencing population divergence. First, we quantified variation by analyzing 10 eastern and 13 western populations from the disjunct distribution of Q. havardii using 11 microsatellite loci, 17 morphological variables, and 19 bioclimatic variables. We then used regressions to examine local and regional correlations of climate with genetic variation. We found strong genetic, morphological and environmental differences corresponding with the large-scale disjunction of populations. Additionally, western populations had higher genetic diversity and lower relatedness than eastern populations. Levels of genetic variation in the eastern populations were found to be primarily associated with precipitation seasonality, while levels of genetic variation in western populations were associated with lower daily temperature fluctuations and higher winter precipitation. Finally, we found little to no observed environmental niche overlap between regions.

Additional phylogenetic analyses of the DNA and histone modifier proteins were performed using several plant species homologs, enabling the classification of the Q. suber proteins. A link between the expression levels of each gene in different Q. suber tissues (buds, flowers, acorns, embryos, cork, and roots) with the functions already known for their closest homologs in other species was also established.

We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing nearly 250 Quercus species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world's oaks. We use a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method to reconstruct shifts in lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling biases. We then map the > 20 000 RAD-seq loci back to an annotated oak genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and phylogenetic support across the phylogeny. Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification, probably in response to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity.

This study used Quercus schottkyana, a dominant tree in subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in southwest China, to investigate the influences of past environmental fluctuations and future changes in climate on the dynamics of tree demographics. Genomic data were obtained for 133 samples of Q. schottkyana from 22 populations using double-digest genotyping by sequencing. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome showed a uniform distribution. Based on principal component analysis and Admixture analysis, two distinct lineages and one mixed group were identified that corresponded to their geographical distribution. Approximate Bayesian computation analyses provided evidence that the divergence among Q. schottkyana populations could be driven by the collision between the Asian and Indian plates during the Miocene, and that climatic fluctuations in the late Pleistocene led to the introgression. The analysis of genotype-environment relationships showed that annual precipitation and geographic distance were associated with spatial genetic variation. Populations of Q. schottkyana in the northern area of the Jinsha River basin were predicted to be the most vulnerable to future climate change. To increase genetic diversity in the northern Jinsha River basin and to buffer threats from future climate change, managers could use a mixture of local and alien seeds during forest restoration and management.

Here, we present genomic evidence that parkland oak populations harbour considerable diversity and grew from local seed sources. We found some evidence for natural regeneration of offspring and for hybridization between pedunculate and sessile oak. We detected signatures of past gene flow between these two species and few regions of high differentiation within their genomes. Future expansion of this dataset may allow us to test for a genomic basis of acute oak decline, a syndrome of particular concern in parkland environments. Summary The two predominant oak species in Europe, Quercus robur (English or pedunculate oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak), have a long history of human intervention. In Britain, a common management regime is parklands, often surrounding country houses. Little is known about how seeds were sourced for parkland oak populations nor the genetic diversity that they contain. We sequenced the whole genomes of 386 trees from four British parkland sites to characterize the nuclear and chloroplast genetic structure and diversity of oak parkland populations. We assembled the chloroplast genomes and matched these to restriction enzyme fragment chloroplast haplotypes found in previous studies of ancient woodlands. We found over two million high-quality nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), allowing us to identify 360 Q. robur, 10 Q. petraea and 16 hybrid individuals with confidence. We identified 81 coding regions exhibiting strong differentiation between the two species. We found evidence for selective sweeps in Q. robur near some regions containing genes with putative involvement in stress tolerance. We detected a few very close relatives within some sites, suggesting natural regeneration or local seed planting. There was little differentiation among the Q. robur populations at the four sites. Chloroplast genomes found in each parkland tended to be similar to those of local ancient woodlands, suggesting that they were derived from local seed sources.",2022,29/05/24 8:53,29/05/24 8:54,29/05/24 8:53,167-181,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,en,"© 2021 The Authors.

Here, we sampled 27 populations across the distribution range of a dominant forest tree, Quercus acutissima, in East Asia, and applied genome-wide analyses to track the evolutionary history and predict the fate of populations under future climate. We found two genetic groups (East and West) in Q. acutissima that diverged during Pliocene. We also found a heterogeneous landscape of genomic variation in this species, which may have been shaped by population demography and linked selections. Using genotype-environment association analyses, we identified climate-associated SNPs in a diverse set of genes and functional categories, indicating a model of polygenic adaptation in Q. acutissima. We further estimated three genetic offset metrics to quantify genomic vulnerability of this species to climate change due to the complex interplay between local adaptation and migration. We found that marginal populations are under higher risk of local extinction because of future climate change, and may not be able to track suitable habitats to maintain the gene–environment relationships observed under the current climate. We also detected higher reverse genetic offsets in northern China, indicating that genetic variation currently present in the whole range of Q. acutissima may not adapt to future climate conditions in this area.

This study examines changes in 5-methylcytosine (m5C) levels in the DNA of seeds during ageing, a process that has important implications for plant conservation and agriculture., Methods Changes in the global level of m5C were measured in mature seeds of oak, Quercus robur. The extent of DNA methylation was measured using a protocol based on two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Viability of seeds was determined by germination and seedling emergence tests., Key Results An ageing-related decrease in total m5C during storage of recalcitrant seeds was highly and significantly correlated with a decrease in seed viability, as reflected by a reduction in germination (r = 0·8880) and seedling emergence (r = 0·8269)., Conclusions The decrease in viability during ageing of Q. robur seeds is highly correlated with a global decline in the amount of m5C in genomic DNA, and it is possible that this may represent a typical response to ageing and senescence in recalcitrant seeds.

In the last years, cork oak stands have been facing a significant decline, which may be aggravated by the climate changes that are predicted to occur within cork oak distribution range during this century. Under this scenario, the assessment of adaptive genetic variation is essential to understand how cork oak may cope with these threats and to delineate strategies for the management of its genetic resources. In this study, six candidate genes possibly significant for environmental adaptation were analysed in cork oak populations from its entire distribution range. Signatures of natural selection were investigated using population genetic statistics and environmental association tests under alternative scenarios of population genetic structure. Signals of balancing selection were detected in the putative non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (NPR1), involved in plant defence response against pathogens, in auxin response factor 16 (ARF16), a gene implicated in root development, in RAN3, also involved in developmental processes, and in glutamine synthetase nodule isozyme (GS), involved in nitrogen fixation.

This challenge can be compounded by collection biases, which may downweight specimens morphologically intermediate between traditional species. Additionally, mismatch between named species and observable phenotypes can compromise species conservation. We studied the species boundaries of Quercus acerifolia, a tree endemic to Arkansas, U.S. We performed morphometric analyses of leaves and acorns from 527 field and 138 herbarium samples of Q. acerifolia and its close relatives, Q. shumardii and Q. rubra. We employed two novel approaches: sampling ex situ collections to detect phenotypic plasticity caused by environmental variation and comparing random field samples with historical herbarium samples to identify collection biases that might undermine species delimitation. To provide genetic evidence, we also performed molecular analyses on genome-wide SNPs. Quercus acerifolia shows distinctive morphological, ecological, and genomic characteristics, rejecting the hypothesis that Q. acerifolia is a phenotypic variant of Q. shumardii.

Oaks are known for limited barriers to gene flow among closely related species. Here, we use Quercus as a living laboratory in which to pursue a fundamental question in plant evolution: Do environmental gradients restrict or promote genetic exchange between species? Methods We focused on two North American oaks, the rare Quercus dumosa and the widespread Q. berberidifolia. We sampled intensively along a contact zone in California, USA. We sequenced restriction site-associated DNA markers and measured vegetative phenotype. We tested for genetic exchange, the association with climate, and the effect on phenotype. Results There is evidence for genetic exchange between the species. Admixed plants are found in areas of intermediate climate, while less admixed plants are found at the extremes of the climatic gradient. Genetic and phenotypic patterns are out of phase in the contact zone; some plants display the phenotype of one species but are genetically associated with another. Conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that a strong climatic gradient can promote genetic exchange between species. The overall weak correlation between genotype and phenotype in the contact zone between the species suggests that genetic exchange can lead to the breakdown of trait combinations used to define species. This incongruency predicts ongoing problems for conservation of Q. dumosa, with implications for conservation of other oaks.",2019,29/05/24 8:41,29/05/24 8:41,29/05/24 8:41,864-878,,6,106,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2019 Botanical Society of America,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajb2.1315,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/WCXVV4YT/Burge et al. - 2019 - Influence of a climatic gradient on genetic exchan.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/GS6AYVQQ/ajb2.html,notion://www.notion.so/Burge-et-al-2019-924e8f01f64c4b92b667e28d35c54a7c,notion,hybridization; genomic; population; RADseq; climate; drought; phenotype; rare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examine the relationships between present admixture patterns and past climatic niche suitability of two East Asian Cerris oaks (Quercus acutissima and Q. chenii) to test the hypothesis that the mid-Pliocene warm climate promoted while the Pleistocene cool climate limited hybridization among local closely related taxa.We analyse genetic variation at seven nuclear microsatellites (1111 individuals) and three chloroplast intergenic spacers (576 individuals) to determine the present admixture pattern and ancient hybridization history. We apply an information-theoretic model selection approach to explore the associations of genetic admixture degree with past climatic niche suitability at multiple spatial scales.More than 70 % of the hybrids determined by Bayesian clustering analysis and more than 90 % of the individuals with locally shared chloroplast haplotypes are concentrated within a mid-Pliocene contact zone between ~30°N and 35°N. Climatic niche suitabilities for Q. chenii during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period [mPWP, ~3.264–3.025 million years ago (mya)] and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~0.022 mya) best explain the admixture patterns across all Q. acutissima populations and across those within the ancient contact zone, respectively.Our results highlight that palaeoclimate change shapes present admixture patterns by influencing the extent of historical range overlap. Specifically, the mid-Pliocene warm climate promoted ancient contact, allowing widespread hybridization throughout central China. In contrast, the Pleistocene cool climate caused the local extinction of Q. chenii, reducing the probability of interspecific gene flow in most areas except those sites having a high level of ecological stability.",01/02/22,30/05/24 6:08,30/05/24 6:09,30/05/24 6:08,231-245,,2,129,,Annals of Botany,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/PBL6RL32/Li et al. - 2022 - Influence of Pliocene and Pleistocene climates on .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/PYTYN2RB/6459351.html,notion://www.notion.so/Li-et-al-2022-e185646dc3e34ce0949b5f2674e52bd4,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physiological measurements and transcriptome sequencing were performed on leaves collected under the P treatments (control, cutting, removal of all lateral branches, and removal of base branches to one-third of seedling height), the W treatments (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times in sequence), and the F treatments (0, 2, 4, and 6 g/plant). Analyses of the physiological data showed that P was more effective than W or F for activating intracellular antioxidant systems. By contrast, W and F were more beneficial than P for inducing the accumulation of soluble sugar. OPLS-DA identified superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and peroxidase as critical physiological indices for the three cultivation measures. Transcriptome analyses revealed 1,012 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the P treatment, 1,035 DEGs in the W treatment, and 1,175 DEGs in the F treatment; these DEGs were mainly enriched in Gene Ontology terms related to the stress response and signal transduction.

Cluster analysis of genetic distances identified two major groups of populations: southern Washington – Oregon and Vancouver Island – Gulf Islands; populations within the island region were particularly homogenous. An isolated mainland British Columbia population near Sumas, British Columbia, perhaps of anthropogenic origin, showed the least genetic variability and greatest genetic distance.

In this study, we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to identify the demographic dynamics and local adaptation of Quercus championii, a dominant forests tree distributed in SCM and Hainan/Taiwan Islands. Through phylogenetic reconstruction, principal components analysis (PCA) and structure analysis, we identified four distinct Q. championii lineages that correspond to its geographical distribution. The genetic structure of Hainan Island population was distinct, possibly reflecting an introgression. We conducted an approximate Bayesian computation analyses and found that Q. championii originated from Southwest China-Northern Vietnam, then dispersed to Southeast China as the climate warmed. During the Pleistocene glacial period, land bridges arose between SCM and Hainan/Taiwan Islands, and the land bridges likely facilitated species dispersal from SCM to these islands.

Our goal is to test whether climate-associated candidate genes show evidence of spatially divergent selection in natural populations of valley oak, Quercus lobata, as preliminary indication of local adaptation. METHODS: Using DNA from 45 individuals from 13 localities across the species' range, we sequenced portions of 40 candidate genes related to budburst/flowering, growth, osmotic stress, and temperature stress. Using 195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimated genetic differentiation across populations and correlated allele frequencies with climate gradients using single-locus and multivariate models. RESULTS: The top 5% of FST estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.68, yielding loci potentially under spatially divergent selection. Environmental analyses of SNP frequencies with climate gradients revealed three significantly correlated SNPs within budburst/flowering genes and two SNPs within temperature stress genes with mean annual precipitation, after controlling for multiple testing. A redundancy model showed a significant association between SNPs and climate variables and revealed a similar set of SNPs with high loadings on the first axis. In the RDA, climate accounted for 67% of the explained variation, when holding climate constant, in contrast to a putatively neutral SSR data set where climate accounted for only 33%.

At multiple spatial scales and multiple geographic contexts within a single species, such information could address a number of fundamental questions about the scale of local adaptation and whether or not the same loci are involved at different spatial scales or geographic contexts. We used landscape genomic approaches from three local elevational transects and rangewide sampling to (a) identify genetic variation underlying local adaptation to environmental gradients in the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata; (b) examine whether putatively adaptive SNPs show signatures of selection at multiple spatial scales; and (c) map putatively adaptive variation to assess the scale and pattern of local adaptation. Of over 10 k single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated with genotyping-by-sequencing, we found signatures of natural selection by climate or local environment at over 600 SNPs (536 loci), some at multiple spatial scales across multiple analyses. Candidate SNPs identified with gene–environment tests (LFMM) at the rangewide scale also showed elevated associations with climate variables compared to the background at both rangewide and elevational transect scales with gradient forest analysis. Some loci overlap with those detected in other oak species, raising the question of whether the same loci might be involved in local climate adaptation in different congeneric species that inhabit different geographic contexts. Mapping landscape patterns of adaptive versus background genetic variation identified regions of marked local adaptation and suggests nonlinear association of candidate SNPs and environmental variables.

Here, we identify genomic variation that may confer local environmental adaptations and then predict the extent of adaptive mismatch under future climate as a tool for forest restoration or management of the widely distributed high-elevation oak species Quercus rugosa in Mexico. Using genotyping by sequencing, we identified 5,354 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped from 103 individuals across 17 sites in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and, after controlling for neutral genetic structure, we detected 74 FST outlier SNPs and 97 SNPs associated with climate variation.

We found that spatial patterns of genetic variation were most strongly associated with precipitation seasonality and geographic distance. We identified regions of contemporary genetic and climatic similarities and predicted regions where future populations of Q. rugosa might be at risk due to high expected rate of climate change.

However, hybridization may also beneficial for rare species by increasing their genetic variation and adaptive potential. Quercus austrocochinchinensis is an endangered oak species that overlaps geographically with the common, widespread Q. kerrii. Morphological intermediates are common in contact zones between the species, suggesting interspecific hybridization. This phenomenon may lead to pure Q. austrocochinchinensis facing a larger threat. Given the importance of leaf morphology for hybrid identification in oaks, we characterized leaf morphological and anatomical features of pure populations of Q. kerrii and Q. austrocochinchinensis and a population of probable hybrids at the contact zone. The results demonstrate that (1) leaf morphological features of putative hybrids are stable and distinct from the parental taxa, and more similar to those of Q. kerrii; (2) anticlinal wall patterns of abaxial epidermal cells show the most significant differences between parental species and probable hybrids, providing an important character for species identification; and (3) putative hybrids were intermediate in leaf anatomical features between the two parental species. The leaf traits for identified Q. austrocochinchinensis, Q. kerrii and hybrids can be used to estimate the hybridization ratio at the contact zone. The morphological evidence, sympatry and phenology strongly suggest that the rare Q. austrocochinchinensis forms hybrids with the more widespread Q. kerrii. Natural hybridization might play an important future role in both migration and adaptation of the species to novel environments. Thus, the characters we identify here for diagnosing hybrids provide an important tool for conserving species and genetic diversity. We suggest that a management plan for Q. austrocochinchinensis should address the conservation of both of the pure species, investigation of gene flow dynamics in the hybrid zone and investigation of the impacts of gene flow on fitness of the two species.",01/01/15,29/05/24 9:29,29/05/24 9:29,29/05/24 9:29,139-151,,1,134,,Eur J Forest Res,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/G8USM8TF/Song et al. - 2015 - Leaf morphological evidence of natural hybridizati.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Song-et-al-2015-58a15ca4baea403daea7c69dcb55a906,notion,Conservation; Endangered species; Hybrid zone; Leaf epidermis; Leaf morphological variation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zonation patterns of species within mountains have been well documented, and shifts in these patterns have been correlated with recent warming. However, the physiological mechanisms that explain these zonation patterns are not well understood. We used a system of broadly sympatric oak species within semi-arid mountains to (1) investigate the extent to which species elevation ranges correlate with climate, (2) test for associations of cold and drought resistances with upper and lower elevation limits, and for trade-offs between resistance mechanisms with elevation, and (3) examine the extent to which species-wide climatic ranges predict traits that drive local community assembly along an elevation gradient. We found that aridity gradients but not winter minimum temperatures predict oak stratification. Species differed in drought resistance, demonstrating a trade-off between drought avoidance and drought recovery. At lower elevations, species avoided drought stress during the dry season through leaf abscission; at upper elevations, they maintained transpiration but recovered from daily desiccation via higher leaf water storage capacity, rather than tolerating desiccation via lower turgor loss points. Freezing resistance, measured as stem electrolyte leakage, was not correlated with elevation differences. Taken together, these results indicate that elevation stratification is linked to drought resistance rather than freezing resistance. We also found evidence of niche partitioning among closely related oaks linked to contrasting leaf phenology. The functional, phenological, and physiological traits important for elevation stratification were correlated with species’ range-wide mean annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality, but not aridity. Our findings indicate that drought resistance along a leaf avoidance–recovery trade-off is integral to species stratification within this semi-arid montane system. Additionally, the mechanism of stratification acts upon traits and strategies conserved at the species level. Species within this system are likely vulnerable to range retraction under increased drought as a consequence of this phenological avoidance–physiological tolerance trade-off.",2018,29/05/24 8:36,29/05/24 8:36,29/05/24 8:36,e02149,,3,9,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2018 The Authors.,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.2149,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/8RJ4S8UB/Fallon y Cavender-Bares - 2018 - Leaf-level trade-offs between drought avoidance an.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/DUEWCEKK/ecs2.html,notion://www.notion.so/Fallon-Cavender-Bares-2018-568a094f478144d0825716c1c528f852,notion,community assembly; drought resistance; ecophysiology; climate limitations; freezing resistance; niche partitioning; range limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quercus magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa are two endemic oak species distributed across the Mexican highlands. These species diverged ecological and morphologically; however, no nuclear genetic differentiation is evident. In this study, we determined the mechanisms that shape patterns of genetic variation and establish the role of migration and hybridization in the evolutionary history of these two oak species. To do this, Bayesian approaches were used for inference on migration rates and directionality and timing of divergence between species using chloroplast microsatellites. We then integrated species distribution models to infer the geographic distribution of Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa during Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, and Mid-Holocene time frames. We failed in distinguishing a unique genetic composition for each species. Chloroplast differentiation was more congruent with geography than the taxonomic status of each species. Our study revealed that after the divergence (c. 10 Mya) of these two oak species, high rates of introgression took place at the end of the Pleistocene. Furthermore, past distribution models predicted that Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa have likely been in sympatry presumable since Last Glacial Maximum and Q. resinosa probably expanded geographically towards its current distribution around Mid-Holocene. This expansion was supported by testing migration models, suggesting recent establishment of Q. resinosa to the north of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. We hypothesized that after Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa diverged, colonization events followed by hybridization between oaks and long-distance seed dispersal occurred, explaining the present-day patterns of distribution of chloroplast diversity. We propose that divergence of species remains mainly on loci under natural selection, providing evidence on the “porous” nature of species boundaries among oaks.",02/10/23,29/05/24 10:02,29/05/24 10:02,29/05/24 10:02,45,,6,19,,Tree Genetics & Genomes,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/FNFCAJN5/Albarrán-Lara et al. - 2023 - Long-distance dispersal drives the genetic variati.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Albarr-n-Lara-et-al-2023-7d92492036bd4a79bd369cded912193b,notion,⋅ Hybridization; ⋅ Long-distance dispersal; ⋅ Mexico; ⋅ Quercus; Chloroplast microsatellites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite being a small clade, they display a range of leaf morphologies comparable to the largest sections (&gt;100 spp.) in Quercus. Their fossil record extends back to the Eocene. Here, we explore how cork oaks achieved their modern ranges and how legacy effects might explain niche evolution in modern species of section Cerris and its sister section Ilex, the holly oaks.We inferred a dated phylogeny for cork and holly oaks using a reduced-representation next-generation sequencing method, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and used D-statistics to investigate gene flow hypotheses. We estimated divergence times using a fossilized birth–death model calibrated with 47 fossils. We used Köppen profiles, selected bioclimatic parameters and forest biomes occupied by modern species to infer ancestral climatic and biotic niches.East Asian and Western Eurasian cork oaks diverged initially in the Eocene. Subsequently, four Western Eurasian lineages (subsections) differentiated during the Oligocene and Miocene. Evolution of leaf size, form and texture was correlated, in part, with multiple transitions from ancestral humid temperate climates to mediterranean, arid and continental climates. Distantly related but ecologically similar species converged on similar leaf traits in the process.Originating in temperate (frost-free) biomes, Eocene to Oligocene ranges of the primarily deciduous cork oaks were restricted to higher latitudes (Siberia to north of Paratethys). Members of the evergreen holly oaks (section Ilex) also originated in temperate biomes but migrated southwards and south-westwards into then-(sub)tropical southern China and south-eastern Tibet during the Eocene, then westwards along existing pre-Himalayan mountain ranges.

Population expansions and contractions, distribution shifts, and climate changes are among the most important factors shaping the genetic compositions of populations. Methods We investigated the phylogeography of an endemic oak, Quercus mexicana (Fagaceae), which has a restricted distribution in northeastern Mexico along the Sierra Madre Oriental and adjacent areas. Nuclear and chloroplast DNA microsatellite markers were used to describe the genetic diversity and structure of 39 populations of Q. mexicana along its entire distribution area. We tested whether population expansion or contraction events influenced the genetic diversity and structure of the species. We also modeled the historical distributional range of Q. mexicana (for the Mid Holocene, the Last Glacial Maximum, and the Last Interglacial) to estimate the extent to which climate fluctuations have impacted the distribution of this oak species. Results Our results revealed high genetic diversity and low genetic structure in Q. mexicana populations. Ecological niche models suggested historical fluctuations in the distributional range of Q. mexicana. Historical range changes, gene flow, and physical barriers seem to have played an important role in shaping the phylogeographic structure of Q. mexicana. Conclusions Our study indicates that the genetic structure of Q. mexicana may have been the result of responses of oak trees not only to heterogeneous environments present in the Sierra Madre Oriental and adjacent areas, but also to elevational and latitudinal shifts in response to climate changes in the past.",2023,29/05/24 8:41,29/05/24 8:42,29/05/24 8:41,e16251,,12,110,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2023 The Authors.

Not only are they ubiquitous in our most common landscapes1 but they have also supplied human societies with invaluable services, including food and shelter, since prehistoric times2. With 450 species spread throughout Asia, Europe and America3, oaks constitute a critical global renewable resource. The longevity of oaks (several hundred years) probably underlies their emblematic cultural and historical importance. Such long-lived sessile organisms must persist in the face of a wide range of abiotic and biotic threats over their lifespans. We investigated the genomic features associated with such a long lifespan by sequencing, assembling and annotating the oak genome. We then used the growing number of whole-genome sequences for plants (including tree and herbaceous species) to investigate the parallel evolution of genomic characteristics potentially underpinning tree longevity. A further consequence of the long lifespan of trees is their accumulation of somatic mutations during mitotic divisions of stem cells present in the shoot apical meristems. Empirical4 and modelling5 approaches have shown that intra-organismal genetic heterogeneity can be selected for6 and provides direct fitness benefits in the arms race with short-lived pests and pathogens through a patchwork of intra-organismal phenotypes7. However, there is no clear proof that large-statured trees consist of a genetic mosaic of clonally distinct cell lineages within and between branches.

We focused on the characterization of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of 22 Quercus species, belonging to four infrageneric groups, using silver nitrate staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and IGS PCR–RFLP markers (produced by the digestion of the rDNA intergenic spacer, IGS). A chromosome complement of 2n = 2x = 24 was confirmed in 21 species, and ascribed to Quercus phellos. Silver nitrate staining detected one or two nucleoli per nucleus, and two nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) per prometaphase cells. FISH performed with rDNA probes revealed two 5S and four 35S rDNA loci in nine species and confirmed their location in the remaining. Since no cytogenetic polymorphisms were detected, the IGS was studied. A single amplicon with ca. 2 kb was amplified in all oaks, and digested with six restriction enzymes, that produced a total of 125 IGS PCR–RFLP fragments with 99.2 % of polymorphism. A monomorphic HaeIII fragment with 225 bp was found. Among the infrageneric groups, 11 monomorphic bands were observed and 6 were considered group-specific. Based on the pool of molecular data different genetic analyses were performed. The UPGMA dendrogram clustered most of the oaks per infrageneric group, and was corroborated by the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). The genetic structure also matched the assumed taxonomy. Globally, IGS PCR–RFLP proved their usefulness for DNA fingerprinting, evaluation of phylogenies and genetic structure, proving to be an adequate complementary tool for rDNA based studies in genus Quercus.",01/05/16,29/05/24 9:14,29/05/24 9:14,29/05/24 9:14,527-544,,5,302,,Plant Syst Evol,Oak ribosomal DNA,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/VPW4JU3L/Coutinho et al. - 2016 - Oak ribosomal DNA characterization by FISH and po.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Coutinho-et-al-2016-d1053f8b5a0347919a55555d43adf10c,,Quercus; Fagaceae; 35S rDNA; Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH); Intergenic spacer (IGS); Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rhizogenic potential of woody plants depends on both genotype and developmental stage. To investigate the role of cyclin transcription in the regulation of cell division during adventitious root induction, we have analysed the temporal expression of a member of the cyclin gene family. The histological modifications that occur during the root induction and formation processes as a consequence of auxin treatments can be detected by the technique of tissue printing for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thus a H2O2 printing assay was performed in parallel with cyclin expression studies. We report the cloning and sequencing of a B-type cyclin genomic fragment from micropropagated cork oak using gene-specific and genotype-independent oligonucleotide primers to conserved regions of the gene. After 48 h of auxin induction, the expression of this B-type cyclin increased, possibly in association with the first cell divisions.

We address our findings in the context of known historical oak distribution from pollen core data derived from previously published research. Location Oak–savanna ecosystems from southern Oregon, USA (core populations/non-glaciated range) northward to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (peripheral populations/glaciated range). Methods We genotyped 378 trees from 22 sites with five chloroplast and seven nuclear microsatellite loci. For both sets of markers, we estimated genetic diversity and differentiation using an analysis of molecular variance and generated Mantel correlograms to detect genetic and geographical distance correlations. For the nuclear markers, we also used a Bayesian approach to infer population substructure. Results There was a large degree of population differentiation revealed by six chloroplast haplotypes, with little (≤ 3) or no haplotype diversity within sites. Peripheral island locations shared the same, maternally inherited chloroplast haplotype, whereas locations in mainland Washington had greater haplotype diversity. In contrast, genetic diversity of the nuclear markers was high at all locations sampled. Populations clustered into two groups and were significantly positively correlated over large spatial scales (≤ 200 km), although allele richness decreased significantly with latitude. Population substructure was observed between core and peripheral populations because rare alleles were absent in peripheral localities and common allele frequencies differed. Main conclusions The observed pattern of chloroplast haplotype loss at the northern periphery suggests restricted seed dispersal events from mainland sites to peripheral islands. This pattern was unexpected, however, as refugial oak populations remained near the current post-glacial range even during the Last Glacial Maximum. Using nuclear markers, we found high within-population diversity and population differentiation only over large spatial scales, suggesting that pollen flow is relatively high among populations.",2009,30/05/24 4:33,30/05/24 4:33,30/05/24 4:33,929-941,,5,36,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2009 The Authors.

Reduced representation approaches, such as restriction-sited associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), have proven useful for phylogenetic studies of non-model species at a wide range of phylogenetic depths. However, analysis of these datasets is not uniform and we know little about the potential benefits and drawbacks of de novo assembly versus assembly by mapping to a reference genome. Using RADseq data for 83 oak samples representing 16 taxa, we identified variants via three pipelines: mapping sequence reads to a recently published draft genome of Quercus lobata, and de novo assembly under two sets of locus filters. For each pipeline, we inferred the maximum likelihood phylogeny. All pipelines produced similar trees, with minor shifts in relationships within well-supported clades, despite the fact that they yielded different numbers of loci (68 000 - 111 000 loci) and different degrees of overlap with the reference genome. We conclude that both the reference-aligned and de novo assembly pipelines yield reliable results, and that advantages and disadvantages of these approaches pertain mainly to downstream uses of RADseq data, not to phylogenetic inference per se.

In this study, we reconstruct the first comprehensive phylogeny of this lineage using a genomic approach (restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, RAD-seq), sampling 35 of the ca. 90 species currently recognized, representing all main morphological groups of section Cyclobalanopsis. In addition, 10 other species of Quercus and two outgroups were also sampled. Divergence times were estimated using a relaxed clock model and two fossil calibrations. Ancestral areas and dispersal routes were inferred using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model. The phylogeny of Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis demonstrates the section to be monophyletic, comprising two main lineages and six subclades that are well supported by anatomical traits. Biogeographical reconstructions indicate that the wide northern hemisphere distribution of Quercus was disrupted in the Late Eocene, leading to the main extant groups at about 33 Ma. The earliest divergences in section Cyclobalanopsis correspond to the phased uplift of the Himalayas and lateral extrusion of Indochina at the transition of the Oligocene and Miocene, where the highest rate of diversification occurred in the late Miocene. Dispersal from Sino-Himalaya and the Palaeotropics to Sino-Japan in the Miocene was facilitated by the increased intensity of East Asian summer monsoons and by the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum.

However, the impact of the interaction between historical and current climatic variation and geological heterogeneity in the TMVB on the genetic and phenotypic diversification within oak species has been scarcely investigated. We used chloroplast DNA microsatellites and a geometric morphometrics analysis of leaf shape to understand differentiation between populations of Quercus deserticola Trel., which inhabits dry highlands along the TMVB. Ecological niche modeling for present-day conditions and projections into past scenarios were performed to evaluate the influence of environmental variables on the evolutionary history of the species. Results showed high genetic diversity ( hS = 0.774) and high genetic structure ( RST = 0.75) and the morphological subdivision of populations into two clusters, corresponding to the west/south and east/north sectors of the Q. deserticola geographic distribution. Ecological niche modeling indicated that the potential distribution of the species has remained similar from the late Pleistocene to the present. Seemingly, the phylogeographic structure of the species has been shaped by low seed-mediated gene flow and mostly local migration patterns.

In this study, we explored the phylogeographic pattern of Quercus fabri, an endemic oak species in subtropical China, to assess the effects of past geographical and climatic changes on the evolutionary history of this deciduous species using three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM). The cpDNA fragments differentiated three phylogeographical groups among Q. fabri populations. A BEAST-derived chronogram based on the cpDNA haplotypes indicated that the initial divergence of Q. fabri probably occurred during the late Miocene (12.33 Ma), whereas haplotype divergence time could date back to the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene. ENM showed that the suitable areas contracted during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and expanded in the warm period during the Pleistocene. Consistently, both the cpDNA and ITS datasets suggested that population expansion occurred after the LGM period (ca. 13–14 kyr) for Q. fabri. Demographical analyses based on multiple genetic datasets and a coalescent-based method also suggested a shrinkage–expansion trend for the effective population sizes of Q. fabri during the glacial–interglacial periods in the Quaternary. Our results suggest that the Neogene and Pleistocene were important periods for triggering species differentiation and intraspecific diversification in Q. fabri, thereby providing insights into the effects of environmental changes in the Quaternary on the population dynamics of endemic tree species in subtropical China.",06/12/19,29/05/24 10:01,29/05/24 10:01,29/05/24 10:01,2,,1,16,,Tree Genetics & Genomes,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/A6XHBIFX/Chen et al. - 2019 - Phylogeography and population dynamics of an endem.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Chen-et-al-2019-684fd45a1dbd49bbba2597053ef6e9cb,notion,Oak; Chloroplast DNA; Ribosomal DNA; Species demography; Subtropical China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 926 trees of five species (Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. hartwissiana, and Q. macranthera) from 70 populations located in different parts of the Caucasus. Sequencing of five fragments with a total length of more than 10 000 bp revealed eight haplotypes, which were typed using chloroplast microsatellite loci (cpSSRs), sequencing, and restriction analysis. The Quercus phylogenetic tree, which includes 34 chloroplast haplotypes of West Eurasian and East Asian roburoid species, confirmed the monophyly of roburoid oaks, which form several lineages that do not have supported topological relationships with each other. The haplotypes identified in the Caucasus belong to two divergent Western Eurasian lineages. These haplotypes are endemic for the Eastern Black Sea and Caucasian region and do not have related haplotypes beyond its borders, which indicates the long-term presence of oaks in the Caucasus and the historical links of the oaks of the Caucasian region with the Eastern Crimea and Eastern Turkey in the absence of chloroplast DNA exchanges with the Eastern European part of the range. The results of the present study show that Caucasian populations could not significantly contribute to the colonization of northern territories and were not influenced by more northern populations, at least through seed transfer. The distributions of the Caucasian haplotypes almost do not intersect with each other, occupying certain geographical areas, which is probably caused by the settlement from individual glacial refugia and genetic drift. The geographical structure of chloroplast DNA variability indicates a long-term presence of oak, in addition to Western Transcaucasia (Colchis refugium), in the regions of the Northwestern, Central, Eastern Caucasus, and Lesser Caucasus.

Sequencing of five fragments with a total length of more than 10,000 base pairs revealed 12 haplotypes of chloroplast DNA. For the haplotype typing in the studied populations, chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSR), sequencing, and restriction analysis were used. Haplotypes detected belong to several divergent phylogenetic lineages. The studied species almost do not differ from each other in the composition of haplotypes and the geographical structure of variability, which demonstrates a certain level of gene flow between them in mixed populations. The haplotypes of the Balkan region are closely related to the haplotypes of previously studied populations from Eastern Europe and the western part of the Russian Plain, and are not found in the Crimea and the Caucasus. On the Crimean Peninsula, two geographical groups of populations are distinguished, which differ sharply in the composition of haplotypes. The difference between the western part of the peninsula and the eastern part is shown, which suggests a multiple origin of oak populations in the Crimea as a result of migrations from two sources, which could be facilitated by fluctuations in the Black Sea level and its desalination, which repeatedly occurred in the Pleistocene and Holocene. The predominance of two divergent haplotypes in the western part of the peninsula, similar to the haplotypes of Asia Minor, indicates the penetration of oak from this region and the presence of an isolated refugium in the mountainous forest regions of Crimea during the last glacial maximum. At the same time, haplotypes common with the Western Caucasus are spread in the east of the mountain-forest part of the Eastern Crimea. The sharp boundary between the areas of distribution of “western” and “eastern” haplotypes in the Eastern Crimea indicates a relatively recent time of the formation of a secondary contact zone between local and Caucasian oak populations as a result of postglacial colonization.",01/06/23,30/05/24 8:07,30/05/24 8:08,30/05/24 8:07,197-212,,3,54,,Russ J Ecol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/7JPG9GH5/Semerikova et al. - 2023 - Phylogeography of Oaks in the Crimea Reveals Pleis.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Semerikova-et-al-2023-6b0700ff54f14a47b49cd210757d23eb,notion,migration; Quercus robur; phylogeography; population genetic structure; chloroplast DNA; Q. petraea; Q. pubescens; ancient refugia; Black Sea region; colonization routes; Crimean Peninsula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mountain uplifts are known to catalyse species radiation but their impact on evolutionarily stable taxa such as many trees remains little understood. The oak Quercus aquifolioides is endemic to yet widely distributed across the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in the Eastern Himalayas. Here, we investigate how the region's Neogene and Quaternary history has driven the species past population dynamics and the resulting extant patterns of intraspecifk diversity. Location: Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in SW China. Methods: We sampled 58 populations throughout the species range and genotyped a total of 959 individuals at four chloroplast DNA fragments and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. Phylogenetic reconstructions, molecular dating techniques and ancestral area reconstructions were used in combination with population genetic statistics to infer the biogeographical history of Q. aquifolioides. The phylogeographical study was complemented by a survey of fossil records and a niche modelling exercise. Results: Combined molecular and fossil evidence indicates that Q. aquifolioides descended during the late Miocene from the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into Tibet and the western Sichuan Plateau, and from there, into the area of highest endemism in the Hengduan Mountains sensu lato. Great apparent population stability and a haplotype 'radiation' in this area contrasted with marked extinction-recolonization dynamics and reduced population diversity in Tibet. We found evidence for extremely limited seed gene flow but extensive pollen gene flow (global FST: cpDNA = 0.98, nSSR = 0.07) with signals of asymmetric pollen dispersal from the Hengduan Mountains into Tibet. Main conclusion: Our results provide insights of unprecedented detail into the ancient biogeographical history of the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot, suggesting that past environmental changes in the region may have catalysed radiative diversifications within species much in the same way as among species.",2017,30/05/24 6:12,30/05/24 6:12,30/05/24 6:11,294-307,,2,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,Publisher: Wiley,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TFLYLNE7/Du et al. - 2017 - Phylogeography of Quercus aquifolioides provides n.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Du-et-al-2017-cdabca0368d04d37839d7ee88cb95482,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we conduct a plastid phylogenomic study of Fagales, aimed at exploring contentious relationships (e.g., the placement of Myricaceae and some intergeneric relationships in Betulaceae, Juglandaceae, and Fagaceae) and dissecting conflicting phylogenetic signals across the plastome. Combining 102 newly sequenced samples with publically available plastomes, we analyzed a dataset including 256 species and 32 of the 34 total genera of Fagales, representing the largest plastome-based study of the order to date. We find strong support for a sister relationship between Myricaceae and Juglandaceae, as well as strongly supported conflicting signal for alternative generic relationships in Betulaceae and Juglandaceae. These conflicts highlight the sensitivity of plastid phylogenomic analyses to genic composition, perhaps due to the prevalence of uninformative loci and heterogeneity in signal across different regions of the plastome. Phylogenetic relationships were geographically structured in subfamily Quercoideae, with Quercus being non-monophyletic and its sections forming clades with co-distributed Old World or New World genera of Quercoideae. Compared against studies based on nuclear genes, these results suggest extensive introgression and chloroplast capture in the early diversification of Quercus and Quercoideae.

A key issue is whether remnant individuals become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata) is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen donors (Nep) and average distance of effective pollen movement (δ). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current Nep = 3.68 individuals. Based on an average adult density of d= 1.19 stems/ha, we assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen dispersal distance (δ) and estimated δ= 64.8 m. We then deployed our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick population to evaluate the extent to which Nep may have changed, as a consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999. Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate Nep was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic isolation.",2002,29/05/24 21:49,29/05/24 21:49,29/05/24 21:49,1657-1668,,9,11,,,"Pollen movement in declining populations of California Valley oak, Quercus lobata",,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01574.x,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/Q4IC3H5V/Sork et al. - 2002 - Pollen movement in declining populations of Califo.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/ZLKNDPMX/j.1365-294x.2002.01574.html,notion://www.notion.so/Sork-et-al-2002-ef049499dcfd4c74a350484f72eebe03,notion,Quercus lobata; genetic isolation; California Valley oak; pollen flow; twogener,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quercus gilva is an evergreen oak species native to China, Japan, and South Korea and is threatened by a long history of human impact. The purpose of this study was to (1) reassess the threatened category of Q. gilva based on a detailed survey, and (2) identify the genetic structure and diversity of Q. gilva based on genomic data. First, we conducted a detailed survey of the populations in China. Second, we collated all the literature and information. Finally, genome-wide genetic variation was analyzed based on 65 individuals from 22 populations. We found that Q. gilva has suffered rapid population decline, and at present, most populations are very small. The evolutionary path of Q. gilva was from the southwest to east of China and then to Japan and South Korea. Quercus gilva showed no distinct genetic structure and had a relatively low genetic diversity. Among the 22 populations, most populations in southwestern China, South Korea, and Japan had high genetic diversity. The populations in Jingning (Zhejiang province; ZJN), Wuyuan (Jinaxi province; JWY), and Zherong (Fujian province; FZR) suffered a strong bottleneck. In conclusion, Q. gilva is an endangered species native to East Asia. Because of the very low genetic diversity of Q. gilva and most populations are small, we need to (1) strengthen the protection of this species, (2) conduct conservation actions with in-situ reinforcement populations, and (3) select populations with high genetic diversity as provenances for afforestation efforts.

However, these models do not address an essential aspect - productivity, which holds economic significance for timber production and ecological importance for carbon sequestration and ecosystem services. In this study, we investigated the potential to extend the CNMs to predict species productivity under various climate conditions. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco.) were selected as our model species due to their comprehensive range-wide occurrence data and measurement of site productivity. To achieve this, we compared and optimized the performance of four individual modeling algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Maxent, Generalized Boosted Models (GBM), and Generalized Additive Model (GAM)) in reflecting site productivity by evaluating the effect of spatial filtering, and the ratio of presence to absence (p/a ratio) observations. Additionally, we applied a binning process to capture the overarching trend of climatic effects while minimizing the impact of other factors. We observed consistency in optimal performance across both species when using the unfiltered data and a 1:1.5 p/a ratio, which could potentially be extended to other species. Among the modeling algorithms explored, we selected the ensemble model combining RF and Maxent as the final model to predict the range-wide site productivity for both species. The predicted range-wide site productivity was validated with an independent dataset for each species and yielded promising results (R2 above 0.7), affirming our model’s credibility.

(holm oak) is a wind-pollinated, sclerophyllous tree that copes with the environmental variability of the Mediterranean climate and that displays flexible ecophysiological adaptability in relation to hydric and thermic stresses. The holm oak dominates Mediterranean woodlands on both acidic and calcareous soils and has been exposed to management (dehesas) for thousands of years. Both protected areas and glacial refugia are supposed to preserve a substantial fraction of the genetic diversity of Iberian species. Genetic diversity was examined for 68 populations sampled throughout Spain using ptDNA SNPs, ptDNA microsatellites, and primarily nuclear AFLPs. Protected populations did not significantly differ from nonprotected populations by any of the measures of levels of genetic diversity. The three-level hierarchical AMOVA indicated that a low number of protected populations harbor most of the species’ genetic diversity. In addition, we found no evidence from either ptDNA or AFLP variation to support that populations from putative glacial refugia are divergent genetic groups as expected during isolation. Outcrossing, anemophilous long-distance pollen dispersal, acorn transport by animals, tree reliance, and habitat availability in Spain probably played a primarily role in homogenizing allele frequency among populations. This result leads us to suggest that extensive gene flow has been prevalent across Spanish populations. We conclude that glacial refugia have not been essential to maintain the neutral genetic makeup of Q. ilex. Nevertheless, conservation of the holm oak in protected areas ensures protection of the species’ genetic diversity, the most widespread woodland ecosystem in Iberia and indirectly the four iconic, endangered animal species (black stork, cinereous vulture, Iberian lynx, western imperial eagle).",03/11/15,29/05/24 9:54,29/05/24 9:54,29/05/24 9:54,124,,6,11,,Tree Genetics & Genomes,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/V5PKW2JC/Guzmán et al. - 2015 - Protected areas of Spain preserve the neutral gene.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Guzm-n-et-al-2015-7c09750f0cb643babebd79299c3dc268,notion,Conservation planning; Holm oak; Genetic conservation; National park; Nonprotected areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new “omics” studies on the genus Quercus are of importance to help finding efficient strategies for overcoming environmental challenges, and to do this, presence of efficient DNA extraction protocols for different Quercus species are very critical. The objective of the present study was to develop new efficient methods for extraction of metagenomic DNA (mDNA) from of Persian oak (Quercus brantii Lindl.) tissues. The efficiency of two newly developed mDNA extraction methods, including indirect SDS-based (ISB or concentrate method) and one spin column-based method (SCB) were compared to that of two classical direct methods, including CTAB-based and SDS-based methods, and two commercial mDNA extraction kits. The maximum average yield of mDNA for all samples (leaf, stem, root, bulk, and rhizospheric soils) was obtained by SCB (258 ng/μl) and ISB (189 ng/μl) methods, respectively. Successful PCR amplification for 16SrRNA and ITS sequence was consistently observed for ISB, SCB, and kit-extracted mDNAs, which confirmed the high purity of mDNA extracted by these methods. The new methods showed more than 96% quantitative PCR efficiency, and partial restriction digestion and metagenomic library construction confirmed the high efficiency of the newly developed methods.

A critical question is how together these two processes influence the evolutionary dynamics of local populations. To assess the respective contributions of pollen and seed flow, we propose a novel indirect assessment of the separate male and female gametic contributions to total effective parental size (Ne), based on parental correlations estimated via kinship coefficients, that can be applied to data sets that include unambiguous genotypes for male and female gametic contributions. Using the endemic Californian valley oak (Quercus lobata) as our study species, we apply this method to a set of microsatellite genotypes for two distinct ecological sets of naturally recruiting seedlings with acorns attached. We found that the effective numbers of contributing male parents (Nep) exceed effective numbers of female parents (Nem) for seedlings established beneath adult trees (Nep = 8.1 and Nem = 1.1), as well as for seedlings established away from adult trees (Nep = 15.4 and Nem = 2.7), illustrating that seed dispersal enhances pollen dispersal and increases the effective number of seed sources in open seedling patches. The resulting effective parental size of seedling populations translates into smaller effective numbers of parents for undispersed vs. dispersed seedlings (Ne = 3.6 and Ne = 6.7, respectively). This study introduces a novel statistic method and provides important new evidence that, on a short-term temporal scale, seed dispersal shapes the local neighbourhood size of new recruits.",2009,30/05/24 4:56,30/05/24 4:57,30/05/24 4:56,3967-3979,,19,18,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04326.x,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/99HP5QA4/Grivet et al. - 2009 - Relative contribution of contemporary pollen and s.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/HW5YKYVN/j.1365-294x.2009.04326.html,notion://www.notion.so/Grivet-et-al-2009-7efdfd5a88bf4b20b7a989f2369aa420,notion,Quercus lobata; pollen; effective parental size; neighbourhood; seed; seedling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, such genetic information is frequently lacking. Here the relevance of genetic surveys to develop efficient conservation strategies for such populations is illustrated using cork oak (Quercus suber) from Minorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) as a case study. Cork oak is highly endangered on the island, where no more than 67 individuals live in small, isolated stands in siliceous sites. As a consequence, it was recently granted protected status. • Methods Two Bayesian clustering approaches were used to analyse the genetic structure of the Minorcan population, on the basis of nuclear microsatellite data. The different groups within the island were also compared with additional island and continental populations surrounding Minorca. • Key Results Very high genetic diversity was found, with values comparable with those observed in continental parts of the species' range. Furthermore, the Minorcan oak stands were highly differentiated from one another and were genetically related to different continental populations of France and Spain. • Conclusions The high levels of genetic diversity and inter-stands differentiation make Minorcan cork oak eligible for specific conservation efforts. The relationship of Minorcan stands to different continental populations in France and Spain probably reflects multiple colonization events. However, discrepancy between chloroplast DNA- and nuclear DNA-based groups does not support a simple scenario of recent introduction. Gene exchanges between neighbouring cork oak stands and with holm oak have created specific and exceptional genetic combinations. They also constitute a wide range of potential genetic resources for research on adaptation to new environmental conditions. Conservation guidelines that take into account these findings are provided.",01/11/09,30/05/24 1:54,30/05/24 1:54,30/05/24 1:54,1069-1076,,6,104,,,Relevance of genetics for conservation policies,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/DNI8HXB9/Lorenzo et al. - 2009 - Relevance of genetics for conservation policies t.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Lorenzo-et-al-2009-af46e11914b84cf8a7744b4c49013def,notion,Population genetics; Evolutionary genetics; Plants; Alleles; Genetic diversity; Cork; Biodiversity conservation; Environmental conservation; Human genetics; Wildlife conservation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been an important resource of timber, fuelwood and animal feed for humans, who actively promoted their presence in forests and other landscape types at least since the early historical times. Besides stands with intensive management, putatively relict populations of three native oak species can be found on unproductive sites with restricted accessibility. Here, we apply chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers in order to address the autochthony of relict and managed stands and compare the spatial distribution of genetic variation between them. Based on data from more than 150 populations, we demonstrate that oak autochthony was preserved throughout historical times which is likely the result of traditional silvicultural treatment. This is supported by the fact that the spatial pattern of chloroplast haplotype distribution still reflects the post-glacial recolonization in both relict and old managed stands. We observed significant admixture of haplotypes only in stands established after the Second World War, which is attributable to the transfer of reproductive material used for afforestation. In terms of nuclear genetic variation, we observed marked differences among species. Quercus pubescens exhibited a pronounced genetic structure. Genetic drift and limited gene flow among its small and isolated populations in our study area might have contributed to this pattern. Varying extent of genetic introgression with other sympatric oak species could offer an additional explanation. On the contrary, the gene pools of Q. petraea and Q. robur are highly homogenous, displaying only weak isolation-by-distance. We found no significant differences of genetic diversity and differentiation between relict and managed stands. This suggests that seed transfer mostly occurred within our study area, even in those stands established in post-war times, verifying previous findings which point out limited human interference. We recommend consideration of population genetic structure for gene conservation, with a finer resolution of gene conservation units needed for Q. pubescens due to its spatial genetic structure. Both relict and old managed stands, species-pure or mixed, are suitable for conservation, as they host autochthonous gene pools. Coppice-with-standard management could contribute to preservation of autochthony. In the face of climate change, it is also important to maintain the evolutionary potential of the stands, by facilitating generative reproduction and allowing for hybridization in mixed stands.",01/01/24,29/05/24 19:21,29/05/24 19:21,29/05/24 19:21,121554,,,551,,Forest Ecology and Management,Relict stands of Central European oaks,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/3Q7X9WXL/S0378112723007880.html,notion://www.notion.so/Neophytou-et-al-2024-83ff6a3542e940b1a24b22367b082027,notion,Genetic diversity; Gene conservation; Microsatellites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Garry oak ecosystems host the most diverse flora for coastal BC, yet they account for less than 0.3% of the province's land coverage. Due to the loss and degradation of Garry oak habitat, many associated plant and animal species that rely on these sensitive ecosystems are endangered. Microsatellite markers were used to investigate temporal changes in fine-scale population genetic structure of 121 Garry oak trees from the Nanaimo region (Vancouver Island, BC) using diameter at breast height as a proxy for age. Overall, allelic diversity was moderate, ranging from 3.0 to 7.5 alleles per locus with a mean of 4.4 (±0.4 SE) across all loci. Global fixation indices ( FST) of 0.06 and 0.09 suggest significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among all populations and age-classified subpopulations, respectively.

The study aimed to describe species distinction in Irish oak populations and to situate this in a European context.• Methods Populations were sampled from across the range of the island of Ireland. Leaf morphological characters were analysed through clustering and ordination methods. Putative neutral molecular markers (AFLPs) were used to analyse the molecular variation. Cluster and ordination analyses were also performed on the AFLP markers in addition to calculations of genetic diversity and F-statisitcs.• Key Results A notable divergence was uncovered between the morphological and molecular analyses. The morphological analysis clearly differentiated individuals into their respective species, whereas the molecular analysis did not. Twenty species-specific AFLP markers were observed from 123 plants in 24 populations but none of these was species-diagnostic. Principal Coordinate Analysis of the AFLP data revealed a clustering, across the first two axes, of individuals according to population rather than according to species. High FST values calculated from AFLP markers also indicated population differentiation (FST = 0·271). Species differentiation accounted for only 13 % of the variation in diversity compared with population differentiation, which accounted for 27 %.• Conclusions The results show that neutral molecular variation is partitioned more strongly between populations than between species. Although this could indicate that the populations of Q. petraea and Q. robur studied may not be distinct species at a molecular level, it is proposed that the difficulty in distinguishing the species in Irish oak populations using AFLP markers is due to population differentiation masking species differences. This could result from non-random mating in small, fragmented woodland populations.

Here, we examine the patterns of species diversification in a monophyletic lineage of oaks endemic to western Mexico, a center of global oak diversity. This group of four species inhabits a variety of soil types and exhibits varying patterns of species distribution ranging from widespread to restricted, with the range bisected by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB). Using chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites, we evaluated genetic diversity, diversification, and genetic group assignment across 49 populations. Chloroplast data identified 29 haplotypes in three distinct lineages, many of these found occurring on opposite sides of the TVB. Individual species were only loosely associated to specific chloroplast haplotypes but the distribution of shared haplotypes supports a one-time wider distribution. One lineage was highly divergent and geographically isolated, likely representing a case of chloroplast capture via hybridization and may indicate a range expansion of Racemiflorae into new territory. Nuclear gene diversity varied little across species and populations; however, differentiation and genetic assignment analysis was strongly structured geographically and tended to cluster with broad soil types. Soil specialist taxa produced homogeneous genetic structure while soil generalists showed varying patterns of mixed ancestry and high levels of admixture. Speciation appears driven by a combination of distance and edaphic factors leading to drift. Hybridization appears to be complementary, occurring most often in non-specific soil environments and in marginal areas, and contributes to a long-scale pattern of gene exchange as species ranges fluctuate with time.",23/03/19,29/05/24 9:59,29/05/24 9:59,29/05/24 9:59,27,,2,15,,Tree Genetics & Genomes,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TQ2BRELD/McCauley et al. - 2019 - Species diversification in a lineage of Mexican re.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/McCauley-et-al-2019-71b54101616e43a8890a5d00e0b8255b,notion,Hybridization; Phylogeography; cpSSR; Ecological speciation; Species disjunctions; SSR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For three mixed stands, qutub8’s FSTsignificantly departed from the expected neutral differentiation patterns (FSTranging from 0.063 to 0.080 for this multi-allelic marker) and thus could be influenced by selection. Significant associations were found between genotypic variation and leaf dimensions as well as leaf structure patterns, after having accounted for species and stand effects.

The complete ITS region (ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2) was amplified in most of the Fagaceae individuals as a single fragment of ∼700 bp. The ITS amplified products were digested with nine restriction enzymes, but only four (HaeIII, HpaII, TaqI and Sau96I) produced polymorphic/discriminative patterns. The total expected heterozygosity (HE) was 20.31 % and the gene diversity (I), 32.97 %. The ITS polymorphism was higher within the Quercus genus (85.3 %). The ITS PCR–RFLP markers clustered the Fagaceae species according to genus or infrageneric group (in the case of Quercus sp. individuals). Five oaks did not cluster in line with the adopted infrageneric classification, but three of these were grouped according to their actual ecological distributions.

We investigated this question for 11 taxa across five genera. In this first study analysing and optimizing ex situ genetic diversity across multiple genera, we found that the percentage of extant genetic diversity currently conserved varies among taxa from 40% to 95%. Most taxa are well below genetic conservation targets. Resampling datasets showed that ideal collection sizes vary widely even within a genus: one taxon typically required at least 50% more individuals than another (though Quercus was an exception). Still, across taxa, the minimum collection size to achieve genetic conservation goals is within one order of magnitude. Current collections are also suboptimal: they could remain the same size yet capture twice the genetic diversity with an improved sampling design. We term this deficiency the ‘genetic conservation gap’. Lastly, we show that minimum collection sizes are influenced by collection priorities regarding the genetic diversity target.

Among other stressing factors, chronic herbivory endangers Quercus ilex, a tree playing a central role in Mediterranean forests. This work addressed the connections between the chemical defenses of Q. ilex leaves and their susceptibility to herbivory, quantitative traits whose relationships are modulated by environmental and genetic factors that could be useful as molecular markers for the selection of plants with improved fitness. A search for natural variants detected the polymorphism D165H in the effector domain of QiMYB-like-1, a TT2-like transcription factor whose family includes members that control the late steps of condensed tannins biosynthesis in different plant species. QiMYB-like-1 D165H polymorphism was screened by PCR-RFLP in trees from six national parks in Spain where Q. ilex has a relevant presence, revealing that, unlike most regions that match the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, homozygous plants are over-represented in “Monfragüe” and “Cabañeros”, among the best examples to represent the continental Mediterranean (cM) ecosystem. Accordingly, the averages of two stress-related quantitative traits measured in leaves, herbivory index and accumulation of condensed tannins, showed asymmetric distributions depending on the clustering of trees based on ecological and genetic factors. Thus, the impact of herbivory was greater in managed forests with a low density of trees from the cM region, among which QiMYB-like-1 D165 homozygotes stand out, whereas condensed tannins accumulation was higher in leaves of QiMYB-like-1 H165 homozygotes from low-density forests, mainly in the Pyrenean (Py) region. Besides, the correlation between the contents of condensed tannins and total tannins vanished after clustering by the same factors: the cM region singularity, forest tree density, and QiMYB-like-1 genotype, among which homozygous shared the lowest link. The biogeographical and genetic constraints that modulate the contribution of condensed tannins to chemical defenses also mediated their interactions with the herbivory index, which was found positively correlated with total phenolics or tannins, suggesting an induction signal by this biotic stress. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed with condensed tannins after tree clustering by genetics factors where associations between tannins were lost. Therefore, condensed tannins might protect Q. ilex from defoliation in parks belonging to the cM ecosystem and carrying genetic factor(s) linked to the QiMYB-like-1 D165H polymorphism.",2023-01,31/05/24 4:18,31/05/24 4:19,31/05/24 4:18,151,,1,24,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/UPZQQ92S/Gallardo et al. - 2023 - The D165H Polymorphism of QiMYB-like-1 Is Linked t.pdf; ,notion://www.notion.so/Gallardo-et-al-2023-a79908e5185a466a8512364eb96c5bc0,notion,(condensed) tannins; <i>Quercus ilex</i>; herbivory; phenolics; QiMYB-like-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We seek to elucidate the evolutionary history of the red oaks of the CA-FP, the Agrifoliae. METHODS: We collected PstI-associated RAD-seq data as well as morphometrics from individuals of the four species across their ranges, including varieties and hybrids. Phylogeny and divergence times were estimated. We analyzed morphological differentiation in over 70 plants using PCA and assessed species delimitation and admixture using genotype clustering analysis in over 40 plants. KEY RESULTS: We find that the Agrifoliae are monophyletic and sister to all other red oak species. Within the Agrifoliae, all species are supported, with Quercus kelloggii sister to a clade of subevergreen taxa: (Quercus agrifolia – (Q. parvula + Q. wislizeni)). Molecular and morphometric analyses are equivocal for named varieties. Notably, Q. parvula var. tamalpaisensis appears to be part of a hybrid swarm between Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni. Dating estimates were concordant with previous hypotheses and geological evidence, with diversification occurring between 10 and 20 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: The Agrifoliae represent a geographically discrete, early-diverging red oak lineage that diversified during the period of drying and warming associated with Sierran uplift during the middle Miocene. Molecular differentiation within the clade supports the current taxonomy, including an east–west species level pattern (Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni) and north–south intraspecific patterns to some degree, although the latter require additional study.",2017,31/05/24 4:05,31/05/24 4:05,31/05/24 4:05,1581-1595,,10,104,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2017 Botanical Society of America,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1700291,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TLYK32WZ/Hauser et al. - 2017 - The evolution and diversification of the red oaks .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/G9MEYTNN/ajb.html,notion://www.notion.so/Hauser-et-al-2017-2393904eb52b41638fccd845a34b91fd,notion,Fagaceae; hybridization; Lobatae; Quercus; RAD-seq; red oaks; restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing; systematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on ITS and 5S–IGS data three major infrageneric groups are recognized for western Eurasia: the cerroid, iliciod, and roburoid oaks. While individuals of the cerroid and ilicoid groups cluster according to their species, particularly in the 5S–IGS analyses, individuals of species of roburoid oaks do not cluster with exception of Quercus pontica. The Cypriot endemic Quercus alnifolia belongs to the ilicoid oaks, in contrast to traditional views placing it within the cerroid oaks. Based on all ITS data available, the groups identified for western Eurasia can be integrated into a global infrageneric framework for Quercus. The Ilex group is resurrected as a well–defined group that comprises taxa traditionally placed into six subsections of Q. sects. Cerris and Lepidobalanus (white oaks) sensu Camus. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest two major lineages within Quercus, each consisting of three infrageneric groups.

We consider the consequences of the diversification process in shaping trait evolution and assembly of oak-dominated communities throughout the continental United States (U.S.). Methods Within the U.S. oaks, we tested for phylogenetic and functional trait patterns at different spatial scales, taking advantage of a dated phylogenomic analysis of American oaks and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). Key Results We find (1) phylogenetic overdispersion at small grain sizes throughout the U.S. across all spatial extents and (2) a shift from overdispersion to clustering with increasing grain sizes. Leaf traits have evolved in a convergent manner, and these traits are clustered in communities at all spatial scales, except in the far west, where species with contrasting leaf types co-occur. Conclusions Our results support the hypotheses that (1) interspecific interactions were important in parallel adaptive radiation of the genus into a range of habitats across the continent and (2) that the diversification process is a critical driver of community assembly. Functional convergence of complementary species from distinct clades adapted to the same local habitats is a likely mechanism that allows distantly related species to coexist. Our findings contribute to an explanation of the long-term maintenance of high oak diversity and the dominance of the oak genus in North America.",2018,29/05/24 8:38,29/05/24 8:38,29/05/24 8:38,565-586,,3,105,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2018 Botanical Society of America,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajb2.1049,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/M5MIVGAT/Cavender-Bares et al. - 2018 - The role of diversification in community assembly .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/CHQSAL7N/ajb2.html,notion://www.notion.so/Cavender-Bares-et-al-2018-e948c5eb604d4a4ea02b19045f9854bf,notion,community assembly; functional traits; complementarity; convergent evolution; diversification processes; environmental sorting; evolutionary legacy effects; phylogenetic structure; species interactions; sympatric parallel adaptive radiation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the benefits of natural regeneration may be jeopardized in small and low-density forest stands, as genetic drift and inbreeding may reduce genetic diversity of the standing population. Particularly in light-demanding tree species, which are characterized by a narrow recruitment window, conservation of genetic diversity during natural regeneration can be challenging in small forest stands. In this study, we investigated intergenerational transmission of genetic diversity in stands of the light-demanding tree species pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) by comparing genetic diversity between adults and recently established seedling cohorts (1–3years old) in four small stands of Q. robur (<4.5ha) that varied in tree density. We also quantified mating patterns and gene flow to investigate their role in shaping the genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of the studied populations. Because of the closed canopy cover of these stands, only recently established seedlings could be studied. When all stands were pooled, the adult cohort showed a slightly but significantly higher allelic richness (Ar) than the established seedling cohort (Ar=11.5 and 10.7, respectively). However, at the stand level, no significant negative effects on the genetic diversity of the offspring generation were found in the small and low-density forest stands. As expected, acorn dispersal resulting in seedling recruitment was restricted to a few meters from mother trees, resulting in significant small-scale spatial genetic structure in the offspring. Pollen inflow from outside the study plots varied strongly among stands, but all plots showed a significant correlated paternity (rp), with higher estimates of rp found in forest stands with lower effective population sizes (Ne) and lower tree densities. Given that high rp-levels may increase the probability of biparental inbreeding and may incur fitness costs in subsequent offspring generations, we recommend that in small scale forestry of Q. robur, Ne and tree densities should be sufficiently large to maintain genetic diversity over the long term. Allowing gene flow between tree populations through reducing the spatial isolation among forest stands, can help to increase Ne in small-scale silvicultural systems of pedunculate oak, but also in other species characterized by narrow recruitment windows.",15/01/14,29/05/24 19:09,29/05/24 19:09,29/05/24 19:09,19-27,,,312,,Forest Ecology and Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/KYLIQM2X/S0378112713007147.html,notion://www.notion.so/Vranckx-et-al-2014-8a351da62d884545ba83ce7facaab0bb,notion,Genetic diversity; L.; Correlated paternity; Mating and gene flow patterns; Naturally established seedlings; Small-scale forestry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restoration plantings are often necessary to restore fragmented forests, complementing the limited natural regeneration. High genetic diversity is critical for the long-term viability of restored forests. However, there is limited knowledge of whether planted populations capture a genetic variation comparable to natural populations. We measured the efficiency of two forest restoration strategies using the common tropical oak Quercus bambusifolia. The multi-seedlot planting was established over ten years by collecting seeds from several locations in fragmented secondary forests of Hong Kong, while the single seedlot planting was established in just one year with seeds from a single natural location. We analysed the genetic diversity and genetic structure from both plantings and compared them with natural populations. The multi-seedlot planting exhibited a higher rate of genetic recovery, greater genetic diversity (He = 0.69), and higher effective population size (Ne_p = 86.5) compared to natural populations (He = 0.66, Ne_p = 64.3, on average) and the single seedlot planting (He = 0.50, Ne_p = 30.8). The multi-seedlot planting erased the effect of seed shadows which was detected in natural populations while the single seedlot planting strengthened the effect. We conclude that capturing high levels of genetic diversity in the collection of propagules is a standard requirement to ensure the long-term viability of forest restoration. Propagule collection over multiple years is required when only a few parental trees are available to avoid founder effects.",15/02/21,29/05/24 19:18,29/05/24 19:18,29/05/24 19:18,118819,,,482,,Forest Ecology and Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/87SJ3P22/S0378112720315887.html,notion://www.notion.so/Zeng-Fischer-2021-2d2ef4f55a6144c1b94c161240637024,notion,Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Multiple seedlots; Natural regeneration; Restoration planting; Single seedlot; Tropical forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive hybridization or shared ancestry have been proposed as alternative hypotheses to explain why genetic differentiation between these oak species is low. Species delimitation is usually weak and often shows gradual transitions in leaf morphology. Hence, individual identification may be difficult, but remains a critical step for both scientific work and practical management.Multilocus genotype data (five nuclear microsatellites) were used from ten Swiss oak stands for taxon identification without a priori grouping of individuals or populations, using model-based Bayesian assignment tests.Three groups best structured the data, indicating that the taxonomical signal was stronger than the spatial signal. Most individuals showed high posterior probabilities for either of three genetic groups that were best circumscribed as taxonomical units. The assignment of a subset of trees, whose taxonomic status had been previously characterized in detail, supported this classification scheme.Molecular-genetic assignment tests are useful in the identification of species status in critical taxon complexes such as the European white oaks. Such an approach is of practical importance for forest management, e.g. for stand certification or in seed trade to trace the origin of forest products.",01/11/08,30/05/24 1:43,30/05/24 1:43,30/05/24 1:43,855-863,,5,102,,Annals of Botany,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/KDV234TK/Gugerli et al. - 2008 - Utility of Multilocus Genotypes for Taxon Assignme.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/8TCG8TXE/158262.html,notion://www.notion.so/Gugerli-et-al-2008-c224db688c094bafb9a2c3cec0bba5b0,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quercus sect. Heterobalanus is now distributed across the Himalaya–Hengduan Mountains (HHM) and warm lowland in East China, yet how the distribution patterns of this group changed in response to the HHM uplift remains largely unknown. This study examines the effect of tectonic events in the HHM region on the oaks, providing a biological perspective on the geological history of this region. Fifty-six populations of Quercus sect. Heterobalanus were genotyped using four chloroplast DNA regions and nine nuclear simple sequence repeat loci to assess population structure and diversity, supplemented by molecular dating and ancestral area reconstructions. The underlying demographic dynamics were compared using ecological niche models of the species distributions during the last glacial maximum and the present. These analyses illustrate that Quercus sect. Heterobalanus diversified as the HHM uplifted and climatic cooling during the mid-Miocene, colonizing the cold habitats from warm broadleaf mixed forests. Lineages in cold highlands and warm lowlands have diverged as a consequence of local adaptation to diverging climates since the late Miocene. Our results suggest that continuous uplift of the HHM in the late Miocene to early Pliocene accompanied by simultaneous cooling triggered the differentiation of oaks.

Within a species, populations with a history of seasonal drought may have evolved the ability to tolerate drought more than those in areas of high precipitation and low seasonality. In this study, we assessed response to water stress in a California oak species, Quercus lobata Née, by measuring changes in gene expression profiles before and after a simulated drought stress treatment through water deprivation of seedlings in a greenhouse setting. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing from nine samples from three collection localities, we identified which genes are involved in response to drought stress and tested the hypothesis that seedlings sampled from climatically different regions of the species range respond to water stress differently. We observed a surprisingly massive transcriptional response to drought: 35,347 of 68,434 contigs (52%) were differentially expressed before versus after drought treatment, of which 18,111 were down-regulated and 17,236 were up-regulated. Genes functionally associated with abiotic stresses and death were enriched among the up-regulated genes, whereas metabolic and cell part-related genes were enriched among the down-regulated. We found 56 contigs that exhibited significantly different expression responses to the drought treatment among the three populations (treatment × population interaction), suggesting that those genes may be involved in local adaptation to drought stress. These genes have stress response (e.g., WRKY DNA-binding protein 51 and HSP20-like chaperones superfamily protein), metabolic (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase and protein kinase superfamily protein), transport/transfer (e.g., cationic amino acid transporter 7 and K+ transporter) and regulatory functions (e.g., WRKY51 and Homeodomain-like transcriptional regulator). Baseline expression levels of 1310 unique contigs also differed among pairs of populations, and they were enriched for metabolic and cell part-related genes. Out of the large fraction of the transcriptome that was differentially expressed in response to our drought treatment, we identified several novel genes that are candidates for involvement in local adaptation to drought.",01/05/17,30/05/24 2:23,30/05/24 2:23,30/05/24 2:23,632-644,,5,37,,Tree Physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/Z99UHF9G/Gugger et al. - 2017 - Whole-transcriptome response to water stress in a .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/5WVIAU2S/2731788.html,notion://www.notion.so/Gugger-et-al-2017-968277d10b6644d1be55635edbd3f60b,notion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
