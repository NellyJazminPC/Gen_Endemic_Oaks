Oaks are known for limited barriers to gene flow among closely related species. Here, we use Quercus as a living laboratory in which to pursue a fundamental question in plant evolution: Do environmental gradients restrict or promote genetic exchange between species? Methods We focused on two North American oaks, the rare Quercus dumosa and the widespread Q. berberidifolia. We sampled intensively along a contact zone in California, USA. We sequenced restriction site-associated DNA markers and measured vegetative phenotype. We tested for genetic exchange, the association with climate, and the effect on phenotype. Results There is evidence for genetic exchange between the species. Admixed plants are found in areas of intermediate climate, while less admixed plants are found at the extremes of the climatic gradient. Genetic and phenotypic patterns are out of phase in the contact zone; some plants display the phenotype of one species but are genetically associated with another. Conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that a strong climatic gradient can promote genetic exchange between species. The overall weak correlation between genotype and phenotype in the contact zone between the species suggests that genetic exchange can lead to the breakdown of trait combinations used to define species. This incongruency predicts ongoing problems for conservation of Q. dumosa, with implications for conservation of other oaks.","2019","2024-05-29 08:41:05","2024-05-29 08:41:12","2024-05-29 08:41:05","864-878","","6","106","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Botanical Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajb2.1315","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/WCXVV4YT/Burge et al. - 2019 - Influence of a climatic gradient on genetic exchan.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/GS6AYVQQ/ajb2.html","notion://www.notion.so/Burge-et-al-2019-924e8f01f64c4b92b667e28d35c54a7c","notion","climate; drought; genomic; hybridization; phenotype; population; RADseq; rare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on ITS and 5S–IGS data three major infrageneric groups are recognized for western Eurasia: the cerroid, iliciod, and roburoid oaks. While individuals of the cerroid and ilicoid groups cluster according to their species, particularly in the 5S–IGS analyses, individuals of species of roburoid oaks do not cluster with exception of Quercus pontica. The Cypriot endemic Quercus alnifolia belongs to the ilicoid oaks, in contrast to traditional views placing it within the cerroid oaks. Based on all ITS data available, the groups identified for western Eurasia can be integrated into a global infrageneric framework for Quercus. The Ilex group is resurrected as a well–defined group that comprises taxa traditionally placed into six subsections of Q. sects. Cerris and Lepidobalanus (white oaks) sensu Camus. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest two major lineages within Quercus, each consisting of three infrageneric groups. Within the first lineage, the Quercus group (roburoid oaks in western Eurasia) and the Lobatae group evolved by “budding” as is reflected by incomplete lineage sorting, high variability within groups, and low differentiation among groups. The groups of the second lineage, including the Cyclobalanopsis, Cerris (cerroid oaks in western Eurasia), and Ilex (ilicoid oaks in western Eurasia) groups, evolved in a more tree–like fashion.","2010","2024-05-29 08:55:47","2024-05-29 08:55:54","2024-05-29 08:55:47","351-366","","2","59","","","The oaks of western Eurasia","","","","","","","en","© 2010 International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) all rights reserved","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tax.592002","","; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/SSWKC6IX/tax.html","notion://www.notion.so/Denk-Grimm-2010-800b2605a5934818af2be2aa6cf3638c","notion","Darwinian classification; intrageneric evolution; intraindividual variability; phylogenetic networks; Quercus; RDNA spacers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, hybridization may also beneficial for rare species by increasing their genetic variation and adaptive potential. Quercus austrocochinchinensis is an endangered oak species that overlaps geographically with the common, widespread Q. kerrii. Morphological intermediates are common in contact zones between the species, suggesting interspecific hybridization. This phenomenon may lead to pure Q. austrocochinchinensis facing a larger threat. Given the importance of leaf morphology for hybrid identification in oaks, we characterized leaf morphological and anatomical features of pure populations of Q. kerrii and Q. austrocochinchinensis and a population of probable hybrids at the contact zone. The results demonstrate that (1) leaf morphological features of putative hybrids are stable and distinct from the parental taxa, and more similar to those of Q. kerrii; (2) anticlinal wall patterns of abaxial epidermal cells show the most significant differences between parental species and probable hybrids, providing an important character for species identification; and (3) putative hybrids were intermediate in leaf anatomical features between the two parental species. The leaf traits for identified Q. austrocochinchinensis, Q. kerrii and hybrids can be used to estimate the hybridization ratio at the contact zone. The morphological evidence, sympatry and phenology strongly suggest that the rare Q. austrocochinchinensis forms hybrids with the more widespread Q. kerrii. Natural hybridization might play an important future role in both migration and adaptation of the species to novel environments. Thus, the characters we identify here for diagnosing hybrids provide an important tool for conserving species and genetic diversity. We suggest that a management plan for Q. austrocochinchinensis should address the conservation of both of the pure species, investigation of gene flow dynamics in the hybrid zone and investigation of the impacts of gene flow on fitness of the two species.","2015-01-01","2024-05-29 09:29:41","2024-05-29 09:29:56","2024-05-29 09:29:41","139-151","","1","134","","Eur J Forest Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/G8USM8TF/Song et al. - 2015 - Leaf morphological evidence of natural hybridizati.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Song-et-al-2015-58a15ca4baea403daea7c69dcb55a906","notion","Conservation; Endangered species; Hybrid zone; Leaf epidermis; Leaf morphological variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied valley oak (Quercus lobata), a threatened species of California (USA) savannas and oak woodlands, with a distribution forming a ring around the Central Valley grasslands. Our main goal was to determine the role of topography and land cover on patterns of gene flow and to test whether elevation or land cover forms stronger barriers to gene flow among valley oak populations. We sampled valley oaks in 12 populations across the range of this species, genotyped each tree at eight nuclear microsatellite loci, and created a series of resistance surfaces by assigning different resistance values to land cover type and elevation. We also estimated recent migration rates and evaluated them with regard to landscape features. There was a significant but weak relationship between Euclidian distance and genetic distance. There was no relationship between genetic distances and land cover, but a significant relationship between genetic distances and elevation resistance. We conclude that gene flow is restricted by high elevations in the northern part of the valley oak range and by high elevations and the Central Valley further south. Migration rate analysis indicated some gene flow occurring east–west but we suggest that the high connectivity in the northern Central Valley is facilitating the formation of these links. We predict that southern populations may become more differentiated in the future through genetic isolation and local adaptation taking place in the face of climate change.","2017-04-01","2024-05-29 09:45:48","2024-05-29 09:46:00","2024-05-29 09:45:48","487-499","","4","218","","Plant Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/JBDJIFT4/Gharehaghaji et al. - 2017 - Effects of landscape features on gene flow of vall.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Gharehaghaji-et-al-2017-e2006bf9edd543148e108e99f738d23a","notion","Circuit theory; Gene flow; Landscape genetics; Landscape resistance; Topography; Valley oak","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quercus arbutifolia is a rare oak in MCFs of southern China and Vietnam. Its isolated populations, small population size and unique ecological niche make this species vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss. In this study, we used chloroplast (cpDNA) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences to investigate genetic divergence patterns and demographic history of five of the six known populations of Q. arbutifolia. Considering its small population size and fragmentation, Q. arbutifolia has unexpectedly high genetic diversity. The time since the most recent common ancestor of all cpDNA haplotypes was c. 10.25 Ma, and the rapid diversification of haplotypes occurred during the Quaternary. The maximum clade credibility chronogram of cpDNA haplotypes suggests that the DM population (Daming Mountain, Guangxi province) diverged early and rapidly became isolated from other populations. The Pearl River drainage system may have been the main geographic barrier between DM and other populations since the late Miocene. ITS data suggests that population expansion occurred during the last interglacial of the Quaternary. The combined effects of pre-Quaternary and Quaternary climatic and geological changes were the main drivers to the current genetic diversity and distribution pattern of Q. arbutifolia. Because of the high between-population genetic differentiation and high within-population genetic diversity of Q. arbutifolia, conservation efforts should be implemented for all populations, but if conservation resources are limited, populations DM, YZ (Mang Mountain, Hunan province) and ZZ (Daqin Mountain, Fujian province) should have priority.","2016-08-30","2024-05-29 09:55:54","2024-05-29 09:56:06","2024-05-29 09:55:54","90","","5","12","","Tree Genetics & Genomes","Conservation genetics of rare trees restricted to subtropical montane cloud forests in southern China","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/U9PF47GI/Xu et al. - 2016 - Conservation genetics of rare trees restricted to .pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Xu-et-al-2016-0bf1bca3b9284790ac13c6594b27f66f","notion","cpDNA; Endangered; ITS; Phylogeography; Population genetics; Quercus subgenus Cyclobalanopsis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Restoration plantings are often necessary to restore fragmented forests, complementing the limited natural regeneration. High genetic diversity is critical for the long-term viability of restored forests. However, there is limited knowledge of whether planted populations capture a genetic variation comparable to natural populations. We measured the efficiency of two forest restoration strategies using the common tropical oak Quercus bambusifolia. The multi-seedlot planting was established over ten years by collecting seeds from several locations in fragmented secondary forests of Hong Kong, while the single seedlot planting was established in just one year with seeds from a single natural location. We analysed the genetic diversity and genetic structure from both plantings and compared them with natural populations. The multi-seedlot planting exhibited a higher rate of genetic recovery, greater genetic diversity (He = 0.69), and higher effective population size (Ne_p = 86.5) compared to natural populations (He = 0.66, Ne_p = 64.3, on average) and the single seedlot planting (He = 0.50, Ne_p = 30.8). The multi-seedlot planting erased the effect of seed shadows which was detected in natural populations while the single seedlot planting strengthened the effect. We conclude that capturing high levels of genetic diversity in the collection of propagules is a standard requirement to ensure the long-term viability of forest restoration. Propagule collection over multiple years is required when only a few parental trees are available to avoid founder effects.","2021-02-15","2024-05-29 19:18:16","2024-05-29 19:18:22","2024-05-29 19:18:16","118819","","","482","","Forest Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/87SJ3P22/S0378112720315887.html","notion://www.notion.so/Zeng-Fischer-2021-2d2ef4f55a6144c1b94c161240637024","notion","Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Multiple seedlots; Natural regeneration; Restoration planting; Single seedlot; Tropical forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These two species are sympatric with Q. afares over most of its distribution. We studied two Q. afares populations (one from Algeria and one from Tunisia), as well as several populations of both Q. suber and Q. canariensis sampled both within and outside areas where these species overlap with Q. afares. A genetic analysis was conducted using both nuclear (allozymes) and chloroplastic markers, which shows that Q. afares originates from a Q. suber × Q. canariensis hybridisation. At most loci, Q. afares predominantly possesses alleles from Q. suber, suggesting that the initial cross between Q. suber and Q. canariensis was followed by backcrossing with Q. suber. Other hypotheses that can account for this result, including genetic drift, gene silencing, gene conversion and selection, are discussed. A single Q. suber chlorotype was detected, and all Q. afares individuals displayed this chlorotype, indicating that Q. suber was the maternal parent.

A key issue is whether remnant individuals become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata) is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen donors (Nep) and average distance of effective pollen movement (δ). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current Nep = 3.68 individuals. Based on an average adult density of d= 1.19 stems/ha, we assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen dispersal distance (δ) and estimated δ= 64.8 m. We then deployed our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick population to evaluate the extent to which Nep may have changed, as a consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999. Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate Nep was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere.

Because most phylogeographic studies have used neutral markers, the role of selection may have been undervalued. In this paper, we contend that plants provide a useful evolutionary lesson about the impact of selection on spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation, when the environment affects which individuals can colonize new sites, and on adaptive genetic variation, when environmental heterogeneity creates divergence at specific loci underlying local adaptation. Specifically, we discuss five characteristics found in plants that intensify the impact of selection: sessile growth form, high reproductive output, leptokurtic dispersal, isolation by environment, and the potential to evolve longevity. Collectively, these traits exacerbate the impact of environment on movement between populations and local selection pressures—both of which influence phylogeographic structure. We illustrate how these unique traits shape these processes with case studies of the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata, and the western North American lichen, Ramalina menziesii. Obviously, the lessons we learn from plant traits are not unique to plants, but they highlight the need for future animal, plant, and microbe studies to incorporate its impact. Modern tools that generate genome-wide sequence data are now allowing us to decipher how evolutionary processes affect the spatial distribution of different kinds of genes and also to better model future spatial distribution of species in response to climate change.","2016","2024-05-30 00:37:35","2024-05-30 00:37:54","2024-05-30 00:37:35","8064-8071","","29","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EQDJ5IXE/Sork et al. - 2016 - Evolutionary lessons from California plant phyloge.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Sork-et-al-2016-e5d2128a477f4f479aa89d430c0a4450","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conservation of imperiled plant species can benefit from ex situ collections, including the living collections of botanic gardens and arboreta. Such living collections should strive to capture and maintain the genetic diversity found in the remaining wild populations. Ex situ collections may also harbor genetic variability that has been lost from wild populations. Quercus hinckleyi is an extremely rare (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources [IUCN] Critically Endangered) oak known from a few sites in Presidio County, Texas. It is the only native US oak protected under the Endangered Species Act. Here we evaluate the genetic variation of the Q. hinckleyi ex situ metacollection relative to that of the remnant in situ population. Methodology. We apply microsatellite genotyping to Q. hinckleyi sampled from plants growing in ex situ collections (N = 22 , from nine gardens) and compare the results with genetic studies of the in situ population. We compare allelic diversity, genotypic diversity, and population structure. Pivotal results. The ex situ metacollection is small but has high allelic diversity and captures about 57% of the allelic diversity of the wild population. Ex situ plants contain 22 new alleles that contribute 13% of the species' total allelic diversity. All ex situ individuals have unique genotypes, none of which were found in situ, and thus they comprise 15% of the species' genotypic variation. The ex situ plants align with only one of three genetic clusters identified in situ, demonstrating an important gap in the ex situ metacollection. Conclusions. The ex situ collection of Q. hinckleyi , while small, is genetically diverse and provides additional allelic and genotypic diversity not currently existing in situ. However, a significant portion of genetic diversity is lacking from ex situ plants, with the metacollection likely derived from only one of the in situ clusters. Collecting seed from the other clusters is a high priority.","2021-04-03","2024-05-30 01:21:41","2024-05-30 01:21:54","2024-05-30 01:21:41","220-228","","3","182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: University of Chicago Press","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/68NN5EN6/Backs et al. - 2021 - Genetic Diversity Assessment of Ex Situ Collection.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Backs-et-al-2021-254144af4a914315b27a393a7a73ad5f","notion","BOTANICAL gardens; conservation genetics; CONSERVATION of natural resources; endangered oaks; ENDANGERED species; ex situ conservation; GENOTYPES; metacollection; microsatellites; PLANT species; Quercus hinckleyi; TEXAS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite being a small clade, they display a range of leaf morphologies comparable to the largest sections (&gt;100 spp.) in Quercus. Their fossil record extends back to the Eocene. Here, we explore how cork oaks achieved their modern ranges and how legacy effects might explain niche evolution in modern species of section Cerris and its sister section Ilex, the holly oaks.We inferred a dated phylogeny for cork and holly oaks using a reduced-representation next-generation sequencing method, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and used D-statistics to investigate gene flow hypotheses. We estimated divergence times using a fossilized birth–death model calibrated with 47 fossils. We used Köppen profiles, selected bioclimatic parameters and forest biomes occupied by modern species to infer ancestral climatic and biotic niches.East Asian and Western Eurasian cork oaks diverged initially in the Eocene. Subsequently, four Western Eurasian lineages (subsections) differentiated during the Oligocene and Miocene. Evolution of leaf size, form and texture was correlated, in part, with multiple transitions from ancestral humid temperate climates to mediterranean, arid and continental climates. Distantly related but ecologically similar species converged on similar leaf traits in the process.Originating in temperate (frost-free) biomes, Eocene to Oligocene ranges of the primarily deciduous cork oaks were restricted to higher latitudes (Siberia to north of Paratethys). Members of the evergreen holly oaks (section Ilex) also originated in temperate biomes but migrated southwards and south-westwards into then-(sub)tropical southern China and south-eastern Tibet during the Eocene, then westwards along existing pre-Himalayan mountain ranges. Divergent biogeographical histories and deep-time phylogenetic legacies (in cold and drought tolerance, nutrient storage and fire resistance) thus account for the modern species mosaic of Western Eurasian oak communities, which are composed of oaks belonging to four sections.","2023-04-11","2024-05-30 01:29:41","2024-05-30 01:29:49","2024-05-30 01:29:41","769-787","","5","131","","Annals of Botany","Niche evolution in a northern temperate tree lineage","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/J4458WYT/Denk et al. - 2023 - Niche evolution in a northern temperate tree linea.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/XBT9DPSI/7048405.html","notion://www.notion.so/Denk-et-al-2023-6dcee880d63849b0b46ee3e1626c9a96","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested several scenarios involving gene flow between these species using the diffusion approximation-based population genetic inference framework and model-testing approach of the Python package DaDi. We found that the most likely demographic scenario includes a bottleneck in Q. engelmannii that coincides with asymmetric gene flow from Q. berberidifolia into Q. engelmannii. Given that the timing of this gene flow coincides with the advent of a Mediterranean-type climate in the California Floristic Province, we propose that changing precipitation patterns and seasonality may have favored the introgression of climate-associated genes from the endemic into the non-endemic California oak.","2021-10-01","2024-05-30 02:08:13","2024-05-30 02:08:31","2024-05-30 02:08:13","663-670","","7","112","","Journal of Heredity","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/8QI6ZL5N/O’Donnell et al. - 2021 - Ancient Introgression Between Distantly Related Wh.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/56JGFPYB/6368840.html","notion://www.notion.so/O-Donnell-et-al-2021-3345820340574facaceffebed3b70415","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phylogeographic studies in this region are few in comparison with other regions and even less for tree species. The aim of the present study was to characterize the phylogeographic structure in 2 partially co-distributed endemic oak species (Quercus costaricensis and Q. bumelioides) of the Costa Rican mountains using chloroplast short sequence repeats (cpSSRs), and to test for the effect of geological and palaeoclimatic processes on their population history. Genetic diversity and structure, haplotype networks, patterns of seed-mediated gene flow and historical demography were estimated for both species. Results suggested contrasting patterns. Quercus costaricensis exhibited high values of genetic diversity, a marked phylogeographic structure, a north-to-south genetic diversity gradient and evidence of a demographic expansion during the Quaternary. Quercus bumelioides did not show significant genetic structure and the haplotype network and historical demography estimates suggested a recent population expansion probably during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The phylogeographic structure of Q. costaricensis seems to be related to Pleistocene altitudinal migration due to its higher altitudinal distribution. Meanwhile, historical seed-mediated gene flow through the lower altitudinal distribution of Q. bumelioides may have promoted the homogenization of genetic variation. Population expansion and stable availability of suitable climatic areas in both species probably indicate that palaeoclimatic changes promoted downwards altitudinal migration and formation of continuous forests allowing oak species to expand their distribution into the Panamanian mountains during glacial stages.","2018-06-27","2024-05-30 02:15:34","2024-05-30 02:15:43","2024-05-30 02:15:34","530-542","","5","109","","Journal of Heredity","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/EMCX4ZPU/Rodríguez-Correa et al. - 2018 - Contrasting Patterns of Population History and See.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/HXSFNC8M/4917313.html","notion://www.notion.so/Rodr-guez-Correa-et-al-2018-ae63cc43f553464b99bf54447210c45e","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within a species, populations with a history of seasonal drought may have evolved the ability to tolerate drought more than those in areas of high precipitation and low seasonality. In this study, we assessed response to water stress in a California oak species, Quercus lobata Née, by measuring changes in gene expression profiles before and after a simulated drought stress treatment through water deprivation of seedlings in a greenhouse setting. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing from nine samples from three collection localities, we identified which genes are involved in response to drought stress and tested the hypothesis that seedlings sampled from climatically different regions of the species range respond to water stress differently. We observed a surprisingly massive transcriptional response to drought: 35,347 of 68,434 contigs (52%) were differentially expressed before versus after drought treatment, of which 18,111 were down-regulated and 17,236 were up-regulated. Genes functionally associated with abiotic stresses and death were enriched among the up-regulated genes, whereas metabolic and cell part-related genes were enriched among the down-regulated. We found 56 contigs that exhibited significantly different expression responses to the drought treatment among the three populations (treatment × population interaction), suggesting that those genes may be involved in local adaptation to drought stress. These genes have stress response (e.g., WRKY DNA-binding protein 51 and HSP20-like chaperones superfamily protein), metabolic (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase and protein kinase superfamily protein), transport/transfer (e.g., cationic amino acid transporter 7 and K+ transporter) and regulatory functions (e.g., WRKY51 and Homeodomain-like transcriptional regulator). Baseline expression levels of 1310 unique contigs also differed among pairs of populations, and they were enriched for metabolic and cell part-related genes. Out of the large fraction of the transcriptome that was differentially expressed in response to our drought treatment, we identified several novel genes that are candidates for involvement in local adaptation to drought.","2017-05-01","2024-05-30 02:23:46","2024-05-30 02:23:53","2024-05-30 02:23:46","632-644","","5","37","","Tree Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/Z99UHF9G/Gugger et al. - 2017 - Whole-transcriptome response to water stress in a .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/5WVIAU2S/2731788.html","notion://www.notion.so/Gugger-et-al-2017-968277d10b6644d1be55635edbd3f60b","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most taxa are well below genetic conservation targets. Resampling datasets showed that ideal collection sizes vary widely even within a genus: one taxon typically required at least 50% more individuals than another (though Quercus was an exception). Still, across taxa, the minimum collection size to achieve genetic conservation goals is within one order of magnitude. Current collections are also suboptimal: they could remain the same size yet capture twice the genetic diversity with an improved sampling design. We term this deficiency the ‘genetic conservation gap’. Lastly, we show that minimum collection sizes are influenced by collection priorities regarding the genetic diversity target.

Here, we analyse one taxon (the white oak, genus Quercus, subgenus Quercus, section Quercus) that is widespread worldwide, and we evaluate its phylogeographical pattern on two different continents: western North America and Western Europe. The goals of the present study are: (i) to compare the chloroplast genetic diversity found in one California oak species vs. that found in the extensively studied European oak species (in France and the Iberian Peninsula); (ii) to contrast the geographical structure of haplotypes between these two taxa and test for a phylogeographical structure for the California species. For this purpose, we used the same six maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and a similar sampling strategy. The haplotype diversity within site as well as the differentiation among sites was alike in both taxa, but the Californian species has higher allelic richness with a greater number of haplotypes (39 vs. 11 in the European white oak complex). Furthermore, in California these 39 haplotypes are distributed locally in patches while in the European oaks haplotypes are distributed into lineages partitioned longitudinally. These contrasted patterns could indicate that gene movement in California oak populations have been more stable in response to past climatic and geological events, in contrast to their European counterparts.","2006","2024-05-30 04:43:49","2024-05-30 04:43:59","2024-05-30 04:43:49","4085-4093","","13","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03083.x","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/4X8YU46C/Grivet et al. - 2006 - Contrasting patterns of historical colonization in.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/9SECU3HF/j.1365-294x.2006.03083.html","notion://www.notion.so/Grivet-et-al-2006-9fff9539e8954458b8999ed7ddfb366d","notion","chloroplast DNA; comparative phylogeography; glaciation; migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the respective contributions of pollen and seed flow, we propose a novel indirect assessment of the separate male and female gametic contributions to total effective parental size (Ne), based on parental correlations estimated via kinship coefficients, that can be applied to data sets that include unambiguous genotypes for male and female gametic contributions. Using the endemic Californian valley oak (Quercus lobata) as our study species, we apply this method to a set of microsatellite genotypes for two distinct ecological sets of naturally recruiting seedlings with acorns attached. We found that the effective numbers of contributing male parents (Nep) exceed effective numbers of female parents (Nem) for seedlings established beneath adult trees (Nep = 8.1 and Nem = 1.1), as well as for seedlings established away from adult trees (Nep = 15.4 and Nem = 2.7), illustrating that seed dispersal enhances pollen dispersal and increases the effective number of seed sources in open seedling patches. The resulting effective parental size of seedling populations translates into smaller effective numbers of parents for undispersed vs. dispersed seedlings (Ne = 3.6 and Ne = 6.7, respectively). This study introduces a novel statistic method and provides important new evidence that, on a short-term temporal scale, seed dispersal shapes the local neighbourhood size of new recruits.","2009","2024-05-30 04:56:57","2024-05-30 04:57:14","2024-05-30 04:56:57","3967-3979","","19","18","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04326.x","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/99HP5QA4/Grivet et al. - 2009 - Relative contribution of contemporary pollen and s.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/HW5YKYVN/j.1365-294x.2009.04326.html","notion://www.notion.so/Grivet-et-al-2009-7efdfd5a88bf4b20b7a989f2369aa420","notion","effective parental size; neighbourhood; pollen; Quercus lobata; seed; seedling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Long-term logging and habitat destruction have resulted in population decline and distribution retreat of Q. tiaoloshanica. To determine the impact of logging on the genetic diversity of Q. tiaoloshanica, the authors investigated the genetic structures using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in four regenerated stands after logging and in one unlogged stand. Compared with the unlogged stand, the effective number of alleles per locus dropped by 1.0% in selective logging stands and by 2.0% in clear logging stands, corresponding to reductions of 3.8% and 5.2%, respectively, in mean Nei's gene diversity and 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in mean Shannon diversity index. No substantial genetic erosion was detected in any of the regenerated stands owing to the high tree density and high heterogeneity of the Q. tiaoloshanica stands investigated. Meanwhile, there was no natural regeneration of the species observed in a Dacrydium pierrei Hickel plantation 700 m away from the regenerated stands, suggesting the limited ability of seed dispersal of Q. tiaoloshanica. Clear logging should be undertaken cautiously because the total number of plant species dropped by 15.2% in the clear-logged stands compared with the unlogged stand. To conserve the genetic diversity of this species, as well as the plant biodiversity of tropical forests, the habitats of Q. tiaoloshanica should be protected against exploitation in terms of agricultural or other forms of land use, and some mature trees should be preserved as seed sources to maintain an adequate regeneration base for this species in the management of logging.

At multiple spatial scales and multiple geographic contexts within a single species, such information could address a number of fundamental questions about the scale of local adaptation and whether or not the same loci are involved at different spatial scales or geographic contexts. We used landscape genomic approaches from three local elevational transects and rangewide sampling to (a) identify genetic variation underlying local adaptation to environmental gradients in the California endemic oak, Quercus lobata; (b) examine whether putatively adaptive SNPs show signatures of selection at multiple spatial scales; and (c) map putatively adaptive variation to assess the scale and pattern of local adaptation. Of over 10 k single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated with genotyping-by-sequencing, we found signatures of natural selection by climate or local environment at over 600 SNPs (536 loci), some at multiple spatial scales across multiple analyses. Candidate SNPs identified with gene–environment tests (LFMM) at the rangewide scale also showed elevated associations with climate variables compared to the background at both rangewide and elevational transect scales with gradient forest analysis. Some loci overlap with those detected in other oak species, raising the question of whether the same loci might be involved in local climate adaptation in different congeneric species that inhabit different geographic contexts. Mapping landscape patterns of adaptive versus background genetic variation identified regions of marked local adaptation and suggests nonlinear association of candidate SNPs and environmental variables. Taken together, our results offer robust evidence for novel candidate genes for local climate adaptation at multiple spatial scales.","2021","2024-05-30 06:51:54","2024-05-30 06:52:09","2024-05-30 06:51:53","406-423","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15731","","; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/CT7EGQ6K/mec.html; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/7QIPQRCK/Gugger et al. - 2021 - Landscape genomics of Quercus lobata reveals genes.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Gugger-et-al-2021-4c79b31fdb1748bb9d2a2fd00e5d31b2","notion","genotyping by sequencing; landscape genomics; local adaptation; natural selection; Quercus lobata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A time-calibrated maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred and analyzed with bioclimatic, soils, and leaf habit data to reconstruct the biogeographic and evolutionary history of the American oaks. Our highly resolved phylogeny demonstrates sympatric parallel diversification in climatic niche, leaf habit, and diversification rates. The two major American oak clades arose in what is now the boreal zone and radiated, in parallel, from eastern North America into Mexico and Central America. Oaks adapted rapidly to niche transitions. The Mexican oaks are particularly numerous, not because Mexico is a center of origin, but because of high rates of lineage diversification associated with high rates of evolution along moisture gradients and between the evergreen and deciduous leaf habits.

Our analyses revealed the presence of two cryptic lineages within Q. chrysolepis. One of these lineages shares its most recent common ancestor with Q. tomentella, supporting the paraphyly of Q. chrysolepis. The split of these lineages was estimated to take place during the late Pliocene or the early Pleistocene, a time corresponding well with the common presence of Q. tomentella in the fossil records of continental California. Analyses also revealed historical hybridization among lineages, high introgression from Q. tomentella into Q. chrysolepis in their current area of sympatry, and widespread admixture between the two lineages of Q. chrysolepis in contact zones. Our results support that the two lineages of Q. chrysolepis behave as a single functional species phenotypically and ecologically well differentiated from Q. tomentella, a situation that can be only accommodated considering hybridization and speciation as a continuum with diffuse limits.","2018","2024-05-30 07:19:50","2024-05-30 07:20:02","2024-05-30 07:19:50","804-818","","2","218","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Authors.

We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing nearly 250 Quercus species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world's oaks. We use a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method to reconstruct shifts in lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling biases. We then map the > 20 000 RAD-seq loci back to an annotated oak genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and phylogenetic support across the phylogeny. Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification, probably in response to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity. The strong support for the phylogeny contrasts with high genomic heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal and introgression.

To provide genetic evidence, we also performed molecular analyses on genome-wide SNPs. Quercus acerifolia shows distinctive morphological, ecological, and genomic characteristics, rejecting the hypothesis that Q. acerifolia is a phenotypic variant of Q. shumardii.

In this study, we quantify the simple and partial effects of geographic proximity and nucleome-inferred phylogenetic history on oak plastome phylogeny at different evolutionary scales. Our study compares pairwise phylogenetic distances based on complete plastome sequences, pairwise phylogenetic distances from nuclear restriction site-associated DNA sequences (RADseq), and pairwise geographic distances for 34 individuals of the white oak clade representing 24 North American and Eurasian species. Within the North American white oak clade alone, phylogenetic history has essentially no effect on plastome variation, while geography explains 11%–21% of plastome phylogenetic variance. However, across multiple continents and clades, phylogeny predicts 30%–41% of plastome variation, geography 3%–41%.

This study investigated whether closely related Quercus lineages have similar spatial genetic structures and moreover, what roles have their geographic distribution, ecological tolerance, and historical environmental changes played in the similar or distinct genetic structures.","2019-11-04","2024-05-31 00:01:32","2024-05-31 00:01:41","2024-05-31 00:01:32","202","","1","19","","BMC Evolutionary Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","BioMed Central","","","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/KM6JZPLC/Yan et al. - 2019 - Ancient events and climate adaptive capacity shape.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/PF4NLKAV/s12862-019-1523-z.html","notion://www.notion.so/Yan-et-al-2019-0d0b92f934794627aeb8983d662684d4","notion","Chloroplast genome; Climate; Geography; Local adaptation; Quercus; Spatial genetic structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23–33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics, we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides, constituting 27,727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs, with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates, which overlapped by only 43–64% in locus coverage. 17% (4,715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size, but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci—due, for example, to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting—are masked by the globally optimal tree. We find no evidence for strongly-supported alternative topologies in our study, suggesting that the phylogeny we recover is a robust estimate of large-scale phylogenetic patterns in the American oak clade. Our study is one of the first to demonstrate the utility of RAD-Seq data for inferring phylogeny in a 23–33 million year-old clade.","2014-04-04","2024-05-31 00:42:09","2024-05-31 00:42:19","2024-05-31 00:42:09","e93975","","4","9","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/WBTRJYAX/Hipp et al. - 2014 - A Framework Phylogeny of the American Oak Clade Ba.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Hipp-et-al-2014-651ef34604904df1b043d9db0b8553d1","notion","Amplified fragment length polymorphism; BLAST algorithm; Gene ontologies; Genetic loci; Nucleotides; Oaks; Phylogenetic analysis; Phylogenetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our assembly includes a nuclear genome and a complete chloroplast genome, along with annotation of encoded genes. The assembly contains 94,394 scaffolds, totaling 1.17 Gb with 18,512 scaffolds of length 2 kb or longer, with a total length of 1.15 Gb, and a N50 scaffold size of 278,077 kb. The k-mer histograms indicate an diploid genome size of ∼720–730 Mb, which is smaller than the total length due to high heterozygosity, estimated at 1.25%. A comparison with a recently published European oak (Q. robur) nuclear sequence indicates 93% similarity. The Q. lobata chloroplast genome has 99% identity with another North American oak, Q. rubra. Preliminary annotation yielded an estimate of 61,773 predicted protein-coding genes, of which 71% had similarity to known protein domains.

No chloroplast (cp) genome information is currently available for Q. bawanglingensis, which would be essential for the establishment of guidelines for its conservation and breeding. In the present study, the cp genome of Q. bawanglingensis was sequenced and assembled into double-stranded circular DNA with a length of 161,394 bp. Two inverted repeats (IRs) with a total of 51,730 bp were identified, and the rest of the sequence was separated into two single-copy regions, namely, a large single-copy (LSC) region (90,628 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) region (19,036 bp). The genome of Q. bawanglingensis contains 134 genes (86 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNAs and eight rRNAs). More forward (29) than inverted long repeats (21) are distributed in the cp genome. A simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis showed that the genome contains 82 SSR loci, involving 84.15% A/T mononucleotides. Sequence comparisons among the nine complete cp genomes, including the genomes of Q. bawanglingensis, Q. tarokoensis Hayata (NC036370), Q. aliena var. acutiserrata Maxim. ex Wenz.

First, we quantified variation by analyzing 10 eastern and 13 western populations from the disjunct distribution of Q. havardii using 11 microsatellite loci, 17 morphological variables, and 19 bioclimatic variables. We then used regressions to examine local and regional correlations of climate with genetic variation. We found strong genetic, morphological and environmental differences corresponding with the large-scale disjunction of populations. Additionally, western populations had higher genetic diversity and lower relatedness than eastern populations. Levels of genetic variation in the eastern populations were found to be primarily associated with precipitation seasonality, while levels of genetic variation in western populations were associated with lower daily temperature fluctuations and higher winter precipitation.

This paper focuses on three emblematic and IUCN Red List threatened oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae), a highly speciose tree genus that contains numerous rare species and poses challenges for ex situ conservation. We compare the genetic diversity of three rare oak species—Quercus georgiana, Q. oglethorpensis, and Q. boyntonii—to common oaks; investigate the correlation of range size, population size, and the abiotic environment with genetic diversity within and among populations in situ; and test how well genetic diversity preserved in botanic gardens correlates with geographic range size. Our main findings are: (1) these three rare species generally have lower genetic diversity than more abundant oaks; (2) in some cases, small population size and geographic range correlate with genetic diversity and differentiation; and (3) genetic diversity currently protected in botanic gardens is inadequately predicted by geographic range size and number of samples preserved, suggesting non-random sampling of populations for conservation collections.

Whether small neighborhood size is a recent phenomenon, a consequence of reduced gene flow caused by demographic changes, or whether it has been historically restricted, remains unclear. To examine this question, we have characterized the spatial genetic structure of N = 191 Q. lobata individuals, spread over an area of 230 ha, using eight microsatellite loci. The observed autocorrelogram suggests an historical standard deviation of gene flow distance of about 350 m per generation, higher than contemporary pollen dispersal estimates. To determine whether our estimates were affected by strong prevailing winds from the west-northwest, we developed and utilized a novel anisotropic autocorrelation analysis. We detected no more than a hint of anisotropy, and we concluded that adult spatial structure is indicative of strong historical signature of ""isolation by distance.""

We seek to elucidate the evolutionary history of the red oaks of the CA-FP, the Agrifoliae. METHODS: We collected PstI-associated RAD-seq data as well as morphometrics from individuals of the four species across their ranges, including varieties and hybrids. Phylogeny and divergence times were estimated. We analyzed morphological differentiation in over 70 plants using PCA and assessed species delimitation and admixture using genotype clustering analysis in over 40 plants. KEY RESULTS: We find that the Agrifoliae are monophyletic and sister to all other red oak species. Within the Agrifoliae, all species are supported, with Quercus kelloggii sister to a clade of subevergreen taxa: (Quercus agrifolia – (Q. parvula + Q. wislizeni)). Molecular and morphometric analyses are equivocal for named varieties. Notably, Q. parvula var. tamalpaisensis appears to be part of a hybrid swarm between Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni. Dating estimates were concordant with previous hypotheses and geological evidence, with diversification occurring between 10 and 20 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: The Agrifoliae represent a geographically discrete, early-diverging red oak lineage that diversified during the period of drying and warming associated with Sierran uplift during the middle Miocene. Molecular differentiation within the clade supports the current taxonomy, including an east–west species level pattern (Q. parvula and Q. wislizeni) and north–south intraspecific patterns to some degree, although the latter require additional study.","2017","2024-05-31 04:05:00","2024-05-31 04:05:10","2024-05-31 04:05:00","1581-1595","","10","104","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2017 Botanical Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1700291","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/TLYK32WZ/Hauser et al. - 2017 - The evolution and diversification of the red oaks .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/G9MEYTNN/ajb.html","notion://www.notion.so/Hauser-et-al-2017-2393904eb52b41638fccd845a34b91fd","notion","Fagaceae; hybridization; Lobatae; Quercus; RAD-seq; red oaks; restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing; systematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Here we use DNA microsatellite markers to characterize the genetic structure of the island endemic species Quercus pacifica K. Nixon & C.H. Mull., found on three of the California Channel Islands, and to examine its relationship to two mainland oaks, Q. berberidifolia and Q. dumosa. KEY RESULTS: We found that Q. pacifica is a genetically cohesive and differentiated evolutionary lineage, diverging from mainland scrub oaks in the Pleistocene with little subsequent introgression. Genetic differentiation of Q. pacifica among islands is small but significant. Both recent and historical gene flow were surprisingly high considering the disjunct distribution of Q. pacifica on islands separated by as much as 125 km of open ocean. Gene flow estimates were highest between the two northern islands and from the northern islands to Santa Catalina. While there is no evidence of recent bottlenecks, historical bottlenecks are indicated on each of the islands. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic cohesiveness of the Q. pacifica species suggests allopatric speciation on the islands with subsequent gene flow that has maintained genetic continuity over great distances.","2016","2024-05-31 04:10:44","2024-05-31 04:10:54","2024-05-31 04:10:44","2115-2125","","12","103","","","Evolutionary history and gene flow of an endemic island oak","","","","","","","en","© 2016 Botanical Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1600259","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/Q3S5ILQ8/Backs y Ashley - 2016 - Evolutionary history and gene flow of an endemic i.pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/P4YB7PU2/ajb.html","notion://www.notion.so/Backs-Ashley-2016-29802c66599f46eea2007fe2d8cb9617","notion","California scrub oaks; gene flow; genetic structure; insular genetic isolation; island endemic; microsatellites; Quercus pacifica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal is to test whether climate-associated candidate genes show evidence of spatially divergent selection in natural populations of valley oak, Quercus lobata, as preliminary indication of local adaptation. METHODS: Using DNA from 45 individuals from 13 localities across the species' range, we sequenced portions of 40 candidate genes related to budburst/flowering, growth, osmotic stress, and temperature stress. Using 195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimated genetic differentiation across populations and correlated allele frequencies with climate gradients using single-locus and multivariate models. RESULTS: The top 5% of FST estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.68, yielding loci potentially under spatially divergent selection. Environmental analyses of SNP frequencies with climate gradients revealed three significantly correlated SNPs within budburst/flowering genes and two SNPs within temperature stress genes with mean annual precipitation, after controlling for multiple testing. A redundancy model showed a significant association between SNPs and climate variables and revealed a similar set of SNPs with high loadings on the first axis. In the RDA, climate accounted for 67% of the explained variation, when holding climate constant, in contrast to a putatively neutral SSR data set where climate accounted for only 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Population differentiation and geographic gradients of allele frequencies in climate-associated functional genes in Q. lobata provide initial evidence of adaptive genetic variation and background for predicting population response to climate change.","2016","2024-05-31 04:13:18","2024-05-31 04:13:30","2024-05-31 04:13:18","33-46","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 Botanical Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1500162","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/JWPGLMTC/Sork et al. - 2016 - Landscape genomic analysis of candidate genes for .pdf; ; /Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/62TCU2C3/ajb.html","notion://www.notion.so/Sork-et-al-2016-8fc203afaa7d4851abb553a53b330c1c","notion","climate change; environmental gradients; Fagaceae; landscape genetics; local adaptation; Quercus; single nucleotide polymorphisms; spatially divergent selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand the genomic features, phylogenetic relationships, and molecular evolution of Q. litseoides, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome was analyzed and compared in Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis. The cp genome of Q. litseoides was 160,782 bp in length, with an overall guanine and cytosine (GC) content of 36.9%. It contained 131 genes, including 86 protein-coding genes, eight ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 transfer RNA genes. A total of 165 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 48 long sequence repeats with A/T bias were identified in the Q. litseoides cp genome, which were mainly distributed in the large single copy region (LSC) and intergenic spacer regions. The Q. litseoides cp genome was similar in size, gene composition, and linearity of the structural region to those of Quercus species. The non-coding regions were more divergent than the coding regions, and the LSC region and small single copy region (SSC) were more divergent than the inverted repeat regions (IRs). Among the 13 divergent regions, 11 were in the LSC region, and only two were in the SSC region. Moreover, the coding sequence (CDS) of the six protein-coding genes (rps12, matK, atpF, rpoC2, rpoC1, and ndhK) were subjected to positive selection pressure when pairwise comparison of 16 species of Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis. A close relationship between Q. litseoides and Quercus edithiae was found in the phylogenetic analysis of cp genomes. Our study provided highly effective molecular markers for subsequent phylogenetic analysis, species identification, and biogeographic analysis of Quercus.","2022-07","2024-05-31 04:28:18","2024-05-31 04:28:31","2024-05-31 04:28:18","1184","","7","13","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/UBP6JZFE/Li et al. - 2022 - Complete Chloroplast Genome of an Endangered Speci.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Li-et-al-2022-5a7e52ab90ac4a1b8b03780fb6a69b90","notion","<i>Cyclobalanopsis litseoides</i>; Fagaceae; montane cloud forests; plastome; repeat sequences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quercus hondae is a rare evergreen oak species (Cyclobalanopsis) endemic to Japan. This species is found in several locations in Southwestern Japan; small populations remain in the tutelary forests of the Japanese shrine. To evaluate the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of this rare species, 11 microsatellite loci and chloroplast DNA sequences are analyzed for 12 populations of Q. hondae and 8 populations of the more widespread congeneric species, Q. glauca. It is found that heterozygosity at both the population and species level is substantially lower in Q. hondae than in Q. glauca. Genetic differentiation among populations of Q. hondae was high, in contrast to Q. glauca, in which populations exhibit largely insignificant differentiation. STRUCTURE analysis shows that at K = 7, the clusters largely corresponded to major predefined populations. This study suggests that there is little gene flow among extant Q. hondae populations and that Q. hondae is genetically differentiated due to the greater effect of genetic drift in small populations. This pattern is in sharp contrast to that of a more common congeneric species, which will be an important consideration in the conservation of Q. hondae.","2022-04","2024-05-31 04:31:55","2024-05-31 04:32:02","2024-05-31 04:31:55","579","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/nelly/Zotero/storage/RRUYADYR/Kamiya et al. - 2022 - Genetic Diversity and Structure of Quercus hondae,.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Kamiya-et-al-2022-4e1841b09c394fffacb297ee989af052","notion","<i>Cyclobalanopsis</i>; chloroplast; genetic diversity; genetic structure; microsatellite; rare endemic species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
